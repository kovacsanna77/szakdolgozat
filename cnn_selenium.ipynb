      " Content: Christmas is a time to be with the ones you love, to give gifts and give thanks, and to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ (if you’re so inclined). It is also a time for gaudy decorations, Griswoldian light displays, mall Santas, and a carnivalesque orgy of capitalist commercialism, formulaic Hallmark movies, and sugary crap. Does this mean, as we hear every year, that we’ve forgotten the “true spirit” of the holiday, or is there something meaningful and worthwhile in the giant tacky spectacle? What does our attachment to the tackiest parts of Christmas say about us and our aesthetic attachment to “low culture”? Whether we’re talking about the holidays, pop music, or frosted lip gloss, it’s high time we develop a more nuanced, empathetic, and less elitist way to talk about pop culture and the politics of “good” and “bad” taste. This is precisely what author Rax King does in her new book Tacky: Love Letters to the Worst Culture We Have to Offer, which explores the meaningful relationships we develop with “tacky” things—from suburban malls and the Cheesecake Factory to the music of Creed—and the complicated social pressures we face from snobbish people telling us we’re bad for liking the things we like. In this special holiday edition of Art for the End Times, host Lyta Gold and TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez talk to Rax King about her book, the power of unfettered (and unashamed) aesthetic appreciation, and the true meaning of Christmas. Rax King is the James Beard Award-nominated writer of the columns “Store-Bought Is Fine” and “Dirtbag Chef,” as well as the host of the podcast Low Culture Boil. Her writing can be found in a range of outlets, including Glamour, MEL Magazine, and Catapult. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Dwayne Gladden Lyta Gold:    Good evening and welcome to Art for the End Times. As always, I’m your host, Lyta Gold. So we started out this podcast so far with two deep dives into fantasy novels because I am the host and I felt like it, and I can do whatever I want. But tonight we’re going to take a step back. We’re going to look at culture from a more meta perspective. Specifically, we’re going to tackle the question of high versus low culture. Now, this is very tricky because when you say high culture and low culture, I mean, everybody knows what you’re talking about. But, then you also will hear something like, there’s this new thing called poptimism, haven’t you heard of it? So in brief, poptimism is this phenomenon, it really started with music critics in the last few decades, it’s expanded since then. Basically, it’s when a critic takes a popular work seriously as a piece of art and celebrates it and treats it like low culture were the same thing as high culture. So, you might be wondering why is that a bad thing? That’s a really good question. We’ll get to it. Another place where you’ll see complaints about poptimism, you’ll see it on the grounds of academia because the sacred grounds of academia, it’s been invaded by poptimism. Unpaid graduate students are writing dissertations on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It’s a world gone mad. So interestingly enough, the poptimism phenomenon, insofar as it’s actually happening, it’s occurring at the same time that arts criticism and academia have lost a lot of prestige and a lot of compensation which feels relevant to the discussion about them. So, there’s a lot to get into this, and this is definitely not going to be our only episode on the subject. But tonight I really would like to stay focused on this question of high culture versus low culture. We’re going to unpack what it means, what liking something really means, and what the political ramifications are of labeling certain art as bad, low culture, popular, and tacky. On top of all that, it’s Christmas, probably, by the time this comes out, and Christmas is a tacky fucking holiday. So we’re going to talk about that. With me tonight I have very special and very merry guests. The first is the editor-in-chief of The Real News Network, my good buddy, Max Alvarez. Max Alvarez:     Lyta, thank you so much for having me on the show, and can I just say it is a goddamn delight? Art for the End Times rocks and we are so excited to have it here at The Real News and to have you be part of The Real News team. So, thanks for having me on. Lyta Gold:      Dang, because I like to think of myself as, no offense to the other shows, but I’m like the rock and roll asshole kid in the background. Everyone else is paying attention; they’re sitting up front, and I’m beating on stuff. Max Alvarez:    You’re Bart Simpson when the teacher walks in and his desk is the only one turned backwards. Lyta Gold:        That’s funny because I’m such a Lisa. I was always a Lisa, like straight up. But in my old age, I’m definitely getting more of a Bart. Max Alvarez:   You’re embracing your inner Bart. Lyta Gold:       Well, The Simpsons is a good example of what we’re going to talk about. But before we get into things, let me introduce our other extremely special guest. She is a writer, a podcaster, the queen of tacky herself. It’s everybody’s favorite person. It’s Rax King. Rax King:        Hi, everybody. I’m sorry I kept snorting during your spiel. I never know when I’m allowed to start snorting on other people’s podcasts. Lyta Gold:      Yes. They were good snorts. Rax King:         Thank you. Lyta Gold:         They were very like, what’s the word for… There’s this word for the way the Jewish people talk where the interrupting thing that we do. Rax King:         Yeah. Annoying, I think – Lyta Gold:        Yeah. Rax King:       – Is the word that people came up with. I always got to – Lyta Gold:       But – Rax King:      – Try not to be too Jewish on other people’s podcasts, I think is the answer. Lyta Gold:        But it’s a problem when I’m around like goyim and they don’t do that annoying… Because I don’t know. Are they approving of what I’m saying? So your snorts made me feel very approved of. Rax King:          Right, yeah – Lyta Gold:      …Should know that. Rax King:       – Because they never jump in with a take. They always wait for me to finish talking, and if you wait for me to finish talking it’s just never going to stop. So, I get nervous and I just keep going. So, yeah. Lyta Gold:       Yeah. Yeah, that’s not this kind of show. This is a Jewish show. Even though we’re going to talk about Christmas and my feelings on Christmas, which are complex. Rax King:         Complicated. Lyta Gold:          Jewish feelings about Christmas are… Yeah. Rax King:         I have Jew feelings about yonder Christmas holiday. Not my favorite. Not my favorite. Lyta Gold:       Yeah. I don’t know. Well, I mean, we’ll get into this, but I’ve grown to like it more. Rax King:          Sure. Lyta Gold:         But it’s got a special… Yeah. It’s hard being a Jew on Christmas. There’s a song about it, and it’s for real. Rax King:       I feel very bullied by all of December, I think. I just feel like it exists to piss me off in a lot of ways. Lyta Gold:       Oh, my God. This one time I worked at a chocolate shop, actually. And we had Christmas music 24/7 during December. I started, because I was losing my fucking mind, I started writing down every time I heard a particular iteration of a song. I had tack marks. It looked like I was in jail. It was very like fights, like the things that you would write down. Angelic eyes you killed. Rax King:      You had like a crazy guy wall with the strings connecting this and that rendition of “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas.” Max Alvarez:     I feel like – Lyta Gold:    I was Charlie Kelly. Pepe Silvia, Christmas edition. Rax King:       Pepe Silvia! Max Alvarez:     I feel like I’ve had basically the opposite trajectory of every Christmas movie. Where they reconnect with the holiday when they rediscover the true spirit of Christmas. In the spirit of Rax’s phenomenal book and the tackiness that is all around us, I feel like the more that I just lean into that, the happier I am by the end of December. Lyta Gold:      That’s a good strategy. I like that. Max Alvarez:     Yeah. I mean, there’s just – Lyta Gold:          I like that. Max Alvarez:     – No shame in it. Just like I can watch Muppet Christmas Carol on repeat, like – Rax King:    That’s a banger though, Muppet Christmas Carol. Nothing wrong with Muppet Christmas Carol. Max Alvarez:   It’s just such a banger. I think Lyta and I were talking about this when we were planning for this. Lyta Gold:         Oh, yeah. Max Alvarez:     We were like, I saw someone tweet. It’s just like, man, what a movie Muppet Christmas Carol is. Michael Caine just fucking acting his ass off, surrounded by a bunch of weird puppets. Lyta Gold:     Like – Rax King:         Just fully in his, like on his Hamlet shit but surrounded by Animal and Gonzo. Lyta Gold:        I don’t mean this in a mean way, but Jeremy Strong could never, like – Rax King:       No, he wishes. Lyta Gold:       His method Muppet acting is something I would pay a lot of money to see. But yeah, he would not. That’s not a scene for him. Rax King:        Michael Caine could play Kendall Roy, but Jeremy strong could not act alongside a bunch of fucking Muppets. \n",

      " Content: With election season coming up, we’re re-launching our Working People series “Working-Class Politics,” where we talk to working-class people running for elected office at all levels—in their unions, in local, state, and national government, etc.—as well as candidates fighting with and for the working class. In the latest installment of this ongoing series, we talk to Paul Prescod (aka “Labor Paul”), a socialist, high school teacher, and member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers. Listeners may know Prescod as the co-host of The Jacobin Show, but he is now running for Pennsylvania State Senate in its 8th district, pledging to make organizing around working-class issues and legislating universal programs his top priorities. We talk to Prescod about the importance of building working-class coalitions, earning the trust of organized labor, and what it will take to serve the needs of working people in his district. Additional links/info below… Featured Music (all songs sourced from the Free Music Archive at freemusicarchive.org):Jules Taylor, “Working People Theme Song” Maximillian Alvarez:     Hey, guys. It’s me again, your intrepid Working People host Maximillian Alvarez, with another quick update before today’s episode. If you listened to our episode earlier this week, then you heard my announcement that we here at Working People are teaming up with our dear friend and host of the show Morning Riot, Mel Buer, to put on a six-hour livestream fundraiser for the 1,400 workers who have been on strike at cereal giant Kellogg’s since October 5th. That livestream is happening this Friday, Dec. 17 from 6:00 PM to midnight Eastern Standard Time, streaming on the Working People YouTube channel. If you check out the show notes for this episode, we have a link to the Working People YouTube channel. We also have a link to the GoFundMe fundraiser page that we set up. A reminder, as I mentioned in my little introduction in the episode earlier this week, Mel and I have been working with the four locals of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union, or the BCTGM, which represents these striking workers at Kellogg’s plants in Omaha, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. All of the funds that we raise, 100% of them, through that GoFundMe campaign will be divided up equally and sent to the four different strike funds for those different BCTGM locals. Now, we’ve been planning this livestream. We’ve got a lot of great guests coming on including representatives from those local unions. We’ve also got some surprise guests that you’re just going to have to watch to find out about. But we’ve also got some amazing guests that we have let the public know about, including Marianne Williamson, including Alex Winter, including perhaps special guest messages from Krystal Ball, and we may also be hearing from other workers, like at the Warrior Met Coal strike, the Columbia strike. So it’s going to be a great, solidarity-filled six hours, and it’s for a really important cause, so please, please, please join us on the livestream at 6:00 PM this Friday, Dec. 17. We’ll be going until midnight. We, again, are trying to raise money for these brave workers and their families, and as I was saying, we’ve been planning this. We’ve got a great slate of folks coming on the stream. We’re going to have a lot of great conversations about the strike, about the labor movement, about what folks around the country and beyond can do to support the working class. But this week has also been a little nuts, because after we announced the livestream, Bernie Sanders – Shout-out to Bernie – Announced that he was going to be doing a rally this Friday as well at the Battle Creek, Michigan, location, which is awesome. And we also learned one day before the livestream was going to go on, that there is a new tentative agreement that has been reached between the union negotiators and Kellogg’s. We wanted to assure everyone that we are still pressing on with the livestream because we are going to learn the details about this tentative agreement. We don’t know what the results will be when the union membership votes on it, but we will know that by early next week. But the fact of the matter is that these workers have been on strike since Oct. 5. They’ve been on meager strike wages for that time. The holidays are coming up, and again, the strike may continue. We don’t know. We’ll hope for the best and we will keep y’all posted with any developments that we hear about on the livestream and afterwards. But these workers still need help, they still need our support, and we can still use this livestream to raise awareness about their struggle, to raise funds for them and their families, and to also, yeah, bring on other folks who are fighting the good fight around the country, help build cross-class solidarity, solidarity between workers in different sectors of the workforce, and between all of us who will be watching, and who are paying attention. \n",

      " Content: African-American communities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, face more than their fair share of political and socioeconomic challenges; at the same time, these communities will play an outsized role in determining the outcome of the next US presidential election. Four years ago, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities launched in the hopes of serving these very communities and modeling an alternative to traditional get-out-the-vote organizations by building genuine community power through year-round canvassing and community engagement.  Reporting from Milwaukee, TRNN’s Jaisal Noor sits down with the organization’s founder and Executive Director Angela Lang to discuss the organization’s mission, tactics, successes, and limitations. See the first part of Jaisal Noor’s interview with Angela Lang here. Studio/Post-Production: Cameron Granadino This story is part of a series that was made possible with the support of the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rigorous and compelling reporting about responses to social problems. Jaisal Noor:        Welcome to The Real News. We’re in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, reporting on the fight back against voter suppression of Black and Brown voters in a city that’s a microcosm for the inequities, inequalities that are in the fabric of America. Where a few thousand votes can determine who becomes the next president, governor, or senator from the state. We’re talking to Angela Lang, founder and executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, a nationally recognized group launched after the 2016 election, in which Trump won Wisconsin on his way to winning the White House amid a sharp decrease in Black voter turnout which was attributed in part to voter suppression. BLOC doesn’t just get out the vote. Instead it works year round in some of Milwaukee’s most disinvested and incarcerated communities to empower residents and build political power. Thanks so much for joining us. Angela Lang:        Yeah. Thanks for being here too. Jaisal Noor:         So Rebecca Kleefisch, who is running for governor next year, says Republicans need to hire mercenaries to win the 2022 race for governor. That’s a headline from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Kleefisch, who’s been campaigning, said she’d also increase voter restrictions if elected, and has embraced the debunked theory that voter fraud handed Trump or was responsible for Trump’s loss in Wisconsin in last year’s election. So what’s your response to this? This is the latest sort of salvo in these mythical lies that Republicans are creating across the country. And it’s interesting because they’re making these crazy claims about stolen elections when the reality is there’s problems with elections in Wisconsin, but it’s not exactly the way that the conservatives have described it. So give us your response and talk about what the actual impediments are to fair elections in Wisconsin. \n",

      " Content: Hospitality workers around the country have faced some of the worst layoffs in any industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNITE HERE, a labor union representing over 300,000 workers, most of whom are in the hospitality, food service, and restaurant industries, reported that 98% of its members were out of work last year. At the five hotel properties in Virginia’s historic Colonial Williamsburg, however, workers who did get their jobs back are being chronically overworked and underpaid, resulting in injuries on the job and little to no ability to have a life outside of work. What’s worse, according to a press release from UNITE HERE LOCAL 25, the union representing hospitality workers at Colonial Williamsburg, management with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation “has skipped seven bargaining sessions since August” and “has refused to meaningfully engage with workers’ demands to end forced overtime. Currently, Local 25 members in Colonial Williamsburg routinely work six- and seven-day weeks in the hotels and 10- and 12-hour days in the taverns, a practice workers are demanding an end to in the next contract.” In this episode of Working People, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with Agatha Hilt, Willie Brown, and John Boardman of UNITE HERE Local 25 about what workers are going through and the status of the current contract fight. Agatha Hilt is a housekeeper at the Williamsburg Lodge and has worked there for the last 11 years, Willie Brown is a houseman at the Williamsburg Lodge and has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for seven years, and John Boardman is the executive secretary-treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 25. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Dwayne Gladden Maximillian Alvarez:    All right. Well, welcome everyone to another episode of Working People, a podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network, and supported entirely by listeners and viewers like you. Audio for Working People is produced by the amazing Jules Taylor, and we are also publishing a video version of today’s episode on The Real News Network YouTube channel produced by our wonderful Studio Manager, Dwayne Gladden. In today’s episode, we’re going to talk about an important worker struggle that’s happening as we speak in the historic Colonial Williamsburg, where hospitality workers represented by UNITE HERE Local 25 who have already endured extended layoffs during the pandemic are fighting back against intransigent management to secure better and fairer work in conditions. According to a press release from the union local this week, “UNITE HERE Local 25, the union representing hospitality workers negotiating with Colonial Williamsburg, has reached out to a federal mediator to help facilitate negotiations with Colonial Williamsburg management. \n",

But the news didn’t stop, and neither did we. Even if we couldn’t cover them in person, our expansion of audio reporting at TRNN allowed us to intimately cover this year’s most important stories and to bring you the voices of people on the front lines of the fight for a better world. In this special year-in-review episode of The Real News Network podcast, Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez and TRNN’s resident radio legend Marc Steiner discuss the importance of audio reporting and the projects we’re working on for 2022. They also recount some of the highlights from our coverage this past year on The Marc Steiner Show, Working People, and TRNN’s other podcast offerings, including: the fall of Kabul to the Taliban; the fight for Indigenous land at Fairy Creek; Jewish activists around the world speaking out against the Israeli occupation; strikes at Kellogg’s, Warrior Met Coal, Frito-Lay, and more; and the introduction of our new TRNN podcast Art for the End Times.

Residents of West Baltimore’s Poppleton neighborhood gave city officials a tour of the overgrown, trash-strewn lots and the mounds of rubble that have come to define their historically Black neighborhood after more than a decade of supposed “revitalization” from well-connected, out-of-town developer La Cité. \n",

      " Content: The dystopian survival drama Squid Game has a bidirectional relationship with the history of modern Korea—just as Korea’s historical context suffuses the plot and characters of Squid Game, Squid Game as an allegory bleeds backwards onto Korea’s historical material reality. Understanding Korea and Korean history, particularly the second half of the 20th century, can help viewers better understand the show; similarly, the show can help viewers better understand Korea’s history and the blood-soaked shadow of American empire that hangs over it. And yet, for the most part, the latter has been curiously absent from the torrents of discourse surrounding the series since it became a global sensation. In the show itself, we get an unflinching look into VIP secrets, we see “where all the bodies are buried.” In this article, I hope to show you how those bodies got there; put them on the slab for examination, and I’ll show you the tentacle marks left on their throats and arms by America’s occupation in Korea.  Before Japan’s surrender in 1945, US military planners at the Potsdam Conference took a map and broke the Korean people in half. According to Dean Rusk, this geopolitical gerrymandering was a compromise between the State Department, which wanted Korea, and the Department of Defense, which did not. No Koreans were consulted. The colonized world saw the end of World War II as an opportunity for independence. Of this, we Koreans dreamed, too. The colonized world saw the end of World War II as an opportunity for independence. Of this, we Koreans dreamed, too. After all, the Allies promised a “free and independent” Korea in the Cairo Declaration of 1943. Following the end of Japanese occupation on Aug. 15, 1945, Koreans demanded their sovereignty. However, on Sept. 8, the American occupation of Korea officially began. One year later, Korean workers waged a general strike—in response, the American “liberators” sent their police to attack. The next month, October, the Uprisings began. In Squid Game, created by director Hwang Dong-hyuk (which, as of this writing, is Netflix’s most-watched series ever), players are forced by dire economic circumstances into a game with such horrific costs that they can only refer to it as a numerical sum: “45.6.” To certain ears, that number will resonate with a distinct echo from history. The Korean War is known to Koreans by a numerical date, “6.25,” the start of our deadliest squid game. Whether we consciously acknowledge it or not, it haunts everything we do. And whether viewers—or Hwang Dong-hyuk, for that matter—consciously recognize it or not, the shadow of American empire haunts everything and everyone in Squid Game.  The Korean War is known to Koreans by a numerical date, “6.25,” the start of our deadliest squid game.

While hazards may be natural, disasters are man-made.

The residents who organized the tour are fighting the city’s use of eminent domain to remove them from the homes they have lived in for decades. “I want everyone in Baltimore to see what eminent domain is like,” said Sonia Eaddy, a third-generation Poppleton resident who has owned her home since 1992. The house has been owned by Black families as far back as the late 1920s—a particularly impressive feat considering Baltimore City’s racist lending practices. Painted on the side of Eaddy’s 321 North Carrollton Ave. home is a 20-foot mural reading: “SAVE OUR BLOCK. Black Neighborhoods Matter. Losing my home is like a death to me. Eminent Domain law is violent.” \n",

      " Content: Ending 26 years of “labor peace,” Major League Baseball is in the midst of a national lockout. With league owners failing to address the core contract issues raised by the Major League Baseball Players Association, the previous collective bargaining agreement expired at the beginning of this month. In an open letter to baseball fans, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated, “Despite the league’s best efforts to make a deal with the Players Association, we were unable to extend our 26-year-long history of labor peace and come to an agreement with the MLBPA before the current CBA expired. Therefore, we have been forced to commence a lockout of Major League players, effective at 12:01 am ET on December 2.” Has the league made its “best efforts” to bargain in good faith? Were wealthy team owners really “forced to commence a lockout”? It sure doesn’t look that way… In this episode of Working People, we’re joined by Alex Bazeley and Bobby Wagner, hosts of the podcast Tipping Pitches, to break down the labor politics in today’s MLB and what the lockout means for players and fans alike. Additional links/info below… Kellogg’s strike links/info below… Featured Music (all songs sourced from the Free Music Archive at freemusicarchive.org): Jules Taylor, “Working People Theme Song” Maximillian Alvarez:    Hey guys. This is Maxmillian Alvarez, your intrepid podcast host. We’ve got a great episode for y’all today and we’re going to jump right into that in just a second. Before we do, though, I wanted to hop in really quick with an important announcement. So as y’all know, 1,400 workers for the cereal giant Kellogg’s have been on strike since Oct. 5 at plants in Omaha, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. A couple of episodes back, I had the honor of talking about the strike with Dan Osborne, who has worked at the Kellogg’s plant in Omaha for 18 years, and currently serves as president of the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, or the BCTGM local 50G. Now, we’ve been wanting to keep coverage up on the Kellogg’s strike here on the podcast, but we’ve obviously also been racing to cover as many of the other crucial labor struggles as we possibly can with the people that we have, i.e. me and Jules. Both of us have other jobs. But if you’re looking for more coverage on the Kellogg’s strike, you should definitely go and check out the work that I and the amazing journalist, a friend of the pod and host of the show Morning Riot, Mel Buer, have been doing over at The Real News Network. So Mel has written two excellent articles from the Omaha picket line, and just last week I got to follow up on my last interview with Dan Osborn by interviewing Dan and Larry Spencer from the United Mine Workers of America. And I’m especially proud of that interview. Larry is serving as vice president for District 20 of the UNWA, which represents the 1,100 coal miners who have been on strike at Warrior Met Coal in Alabama since April. You guys may remember Larry. I think he made an appearance in one of the podcast episodes that we did on the strike that was hosted by our wonderful friends down there at the Valley Labor Report. But I thought that it was really important to get folks from the Warrior Met strike and the Kellogg’s strike on the same interview. And I thought that Larry and Dan did an incredible job breaking down where things stand with each of these important strikes. We also discuss the ways that companies like Kellogg’s and Warrior Met have been weaponizing business friendly-courts to try to break strikes. Anyway, my point is that if you like the Working People interview that I did with Dan Osborn a few episodes ago, and you have been hoping for more coverage from me and others on the strike, we’ve been keeping that coverage up over at The Real News. And we’ve linked to those pieces that I mentioned from me and Mel Buer in the show notes here. \n",

The former Maryland Chief Medical Examiner made headlines when he testified Floyd died in part due to exhaust from a tail pipe. The testimony raised questions about his competence and police bias, and lead nearly 400 medical pathologists to call for review of his rulings on ‘police-involved’ deaths during his tenure in Maryland. This week, in response to a request from The Real News Network, the state of Maryland released a list of roughly 1,400 cases of in-custody deaths that occurred during Fowler’s tenure. The list has been turned over the the Maryland Attorney General’s office for review by a panel of experts.

      " Content: “What does the Service Employee International Union (SEIU) mean to you?” That is the question I started with when this project began. With union density having reached historic lows in this country, “union” is just a word for most people. For the seven SEIU Local 1 members in Chicago I profiled for this project, including Patrick O’Malley, a doorman at a residential building on East Lakeshore Drive, it’s much more.  “Because of SEIU Local 1, workers now have a voice on the job. We have the ability to talk to employers about things we need like health insurance, retirement benefits, and wages that reflect our work. I am proud to be a doorman. I am proud to be a Chicagoan. I am proud to be union,” O’Malley said.  After years of struggle, Chicago Flat Janitor’s Union signed a historic agreement in 1917 with the Chicago Real Estate Board. Terms of the contract included a closed shop, arbitration of disputes, and a ban on forcing the wives of janitors to do janitorial work.  In 1904, a diverse group of immigrant janitors, window washers, and elevator operators—including Eastern European, African, and Irish workers—joined together to form the Chicago Flat Janitor’s Union to fight for better wages and working conditions. The janitors union would become the nation’s first union of building employees, a precursor to SEIU.  When I am asked, “Why didn’t you just find a new job?”, simply put: I loved my job. I found fulfillment in my job… This job was worth fighting for. Today, SEIU Local 1 has branched out from its storied Chicago roots and now represents 50,000 workers across six states—Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana—in such professions as security, commercial, food service, airports, janitorial, and residential. \n",

The European Commission—the unelected body of technocrats that designs European Union legislation—isn’t exactly known as a friend of the worker. EU commissioners and their staff are more likely to be found having coffee with corporate lobbyists than rubbing shoulders with the working class. Yet, last week, the EU Commission proposed what some are hailing as the most pro-worker reform to come out of the EU in years—a directive to regulate platform work. Often unfairly treated as self-employed, platform workers are now to be considered employees and thus entitled to the labor rights that are standard for most workers in Europe. The move also promises a new set of rights in relation to the algorithmic management of work. This legislation wasn’t just delivered from on high. It has emerged in the context of an increasingly loud and effective platform workers’ movement—and a capitalist class divided about how to respond to the emergence of digital labor platforms. \n",

      " Content: After spending the past year and a half socially distancing, millions around the country will be coming together to celebrate the holidays this year with a renewed appreciation for seeing and being with loved ones. For those who are locked away in prisons and jails, however, the dehumanizing separation from family, friends, and community will continue. Having spent 44 years as a political prisoner, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway has an intimate knowledge of just how painful the holidays are for incarcerated people and why suicides, violence, and depression spike for prisoners this time of year. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, Conway and TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez have an open and emotional discussion about what it’s like to be locked up during the holidays and about the importance of doing what we can to help prisoners maintain contact with the outside world. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:     Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars.

      " Content: 2021 has been a pivotal year for the labor movement. As we have covered extensively here at TRNN, through strikes, unionization campaigns, protest actions, and record numbers of people quitting their jobs, workers across sectors are showing a level of assertiveness and increased militancy that we haven’t seen in decades. How far will this “labor awakening” go? How do we harness the rank-and-file energy driving these actions and use it to build a more robust and powerful labor movement? And can that movement fuse with other struggles for social and economic change to be a formidable political force? These are the kinds of questions that members of Organizing Upgrade are asking on a daily basis—and, in many ways, our future depends on the answers we come up with. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc welcomes back Alex Han, longtime labor organizer and new executive editor of Organizing Upgrade, to take stock of this year’s surge in labor militancy and to discuss the strategic steps that need to be taken to build labor power in the US, combat right-wing authoritarianism, and advance the cause of multiracial democracy. Alex Han has organized with unions, in the community, and in progressive politics for two decades. As a vice president of SEIU (Service Employees International Union) Healthcare Illinois and Indiana, he helped tens of thousands of home-based healthcare and childcare workers unionize. He helped found United Working Families and he served on the national political team for the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2020. He has also worked with labor and community organizations around the country as part of the Bargaining for the Common Good network. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Monday and Thursday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Stephen Frank, Dwayne Gladden Marc Steiner: Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. There’s been a lot of [inaudible] right now. Workers are not only striking and threatening to strike, but organizing among workers in places like Starbucks and Walmart and other unorganized sectors is taking place as never before. And Real News has been covering these labor issues intensely over the last year. In part because of Editor-in-Chief Max Alvarez’s podcast Working People. And we here on The Steiner Show have been also covering labor and organizing. Last February, I talked to Boston’s SEIU Local 888 Chief of Staff Rand Wilson. He said then this would be a year of unprecedented labor action. And he was right. And today we continue these conversations but with Alex Han, who joined me as well in the past year, when he was vice president for SEIU. He’s now taken the position of executive director of Organizing Upgrade. And together we’ll look at this year of labor organizing and strikes, and the rising power of labor, political and community organizing in our country. This is also a critical moment in our history and for our future, as the right wing rises in power and conservatives dominate in courts, and right wing state governments are taking hold. And they whittle away at all the labor, civil rights, that movements on the left have won in voting rights, labor power, and women’s rights and more. So we’re going to talk about the power of labor rising and what we face as organizers. \n",

      " Content: 1,100 coal miners at Warrior Met Coal in Alabama have been on strike since April 1, and 1,400 Kellogg’s workers at cereal plants in Nebraska, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have been on strike since Oct. 5. Facing intense financial, physical, and psychological strains from being on strike for so long, violence and hostility from scab workers on the picket line, and threats of being permanently replaced, these workers have held strong. However, they are now facing additional obstacles imposed by business-friendly courts that are stripping their legally protected right to picket. At the Warrior Met picket line in Brookwood, Alabama, as well as the Kellogg’s picket line in Omaha, Nebraska, striking union workers have been slapped with injunctions that restrict who can picket, how close they can stand to company entrances, what they can and can’t do, etc. But the unions aren’t giving up without a fight. “For too long, the courts have sided with corporations over labor, fundamentally and perniciously reshaping American law, life and liberty,” Sara Nelson, president of the American Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, recently wrote in The New York Times. “Today, they are doing their part to unravel the American dream—and the social contract that has been in place since the 1940s, offering the working class a good life if they spend 40 hours on the job, the means to enjoy it in off hours and a secure retirement.” To discuss where things stand now with each of these important strikes and how companies like Kellogg’s and Warrior Met Coal are trying to use the courts to break them, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with Larry Spencer in Alabama and Dan Osborn in Nebraska. Larry Spencer is currently serving as Vice President for District 20 of the United Mine Workers of America, which represents the 1,100 miners who have been on strike at Warrior Met Coal since April. Dan Osborn has worked at the Kellogg’s plant in Omaha, Nebraska, for 18 years and currently serves as president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), Local 50G.

      " Content: This week, during a special legislative session, Maryland’s Democrats began to undo some of Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s cruel and antediluvian vetoes.  Among the priorities was removing the governor from the decision-making process regarding whether or not people serving life sentences with the chance of parole can receive parole. Maryland was one of just three states that allowed the governor a vote in such decisions. Additionally, Democrats overturned Hogan’s veto of the Dignity Not Detention Act, which bans Maryland counties from working with ICE and holding detainees in their jail. It also prevents law enforcement from asking about one’s immigration status during traffic stops. There was also a big kerfuffle around redistricting, which Maryland Matters covered extensively. One veto that was not overturned, much to the frustration of harm reduction advocates and people who use drugs, was related to decriminalizing paraphernalia used for injecting drugs. In Maryland, possession of paraphernalia used to inject drugs can lead to as many as four years in prison—much more than drug possession, which can lead to up to one year in prison. That law will remain on the books. \n",

      " Content: The battle over the right to record police is far from over. That’s because a case pending over a routine traffic stop in Lakewood, Colorado, where police interfered with a citizen journalist recording, could have a huge impact on a controversial legal precedent that shields cops from legal liability. Post-Production: Adam Coley Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to achieve that goal by examining how a Cop Watcher’s efforts to record police, and what cops did in response is actually leading to some truly surprising developments in our legal system. In fact, what is happening is so profound it calls into question the entire notion that the Cop Watcher’s work is a worthless endeavor in search of clicks. But before we get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. You know I read your comments and appreciate them. And of course you can always reach out to me directly @tayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And of course, if you can, please hit the Patreon link pinned below in the comment, because we do have some extras for our PAR family. All right, now we’ve gotten all that out of the way. Now, everyone who watches this show knows that we don’t just report on bad cops, but we also focus on the people who watch them. Meaning citizen journalists with their own YouTube channels, whose efforts to document law enforcement overreach have been both popular and controversial. Most of the criticism can be summarized thusly: Cop Watchers and auditors, otherwise known as frauditors, don’t really accomplish any real change. Instead, they simply provoke police to get clicks and eventually monetize their videos in exchange for cash. So, first, I’m not even going to weigh into the debate about monetizing a video. Every major news corporation does, so why is it so deplorable for a citizen journalist to do the same? Nobody seems to criticize how companies like Google and Facebook monetize practically everything we do and then sell the data. But today, I want to address the second prong of the frauditors argument. Namely, to quote beloved American author William Faulkner, Cop Watchers are full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Well, interestingly, a recent case pretty much turns that notion on its head. It involves a Cop Watcher known as Liberty Freak or Abade. He is and was a video activist who worked closely with controversial fellow Cop Watcher Eric Brandt, who has also been accused of being nothing more than a social menace. But as I already mentioned, a case before the Federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals may actually put these two YouTubers in a position to do something pretty extraordinary. What I mean is that according to the briefs filed with court in support of their case, the video you are now seeing on screen, has the potential to deliver a stinging blow to the legal orthodoxy which has made police almost immune to accountability. \n",

Now, the new monster in the closet is Inflation.” With all eyes on President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan, which would entail massive and sorely needed social investments in education, healthcare, childcare, clean energy, and more, a familiar chorus of budgetary hand wringers has emerged to argue that such social spending is the cause of increased inflation. As Sawicky argues, that’s nonsense. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, now available in video form, Marc and Sawicky break down the current levels of inflation and discuss the political motivations behind the moral panic over inflation, which is essentially a new form of old-school deficit hawkery. Max Sawicky is an economist, writer, and senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research; he has worked at the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Government Accountability Office.

      " Content: Starbucks is the world’s largest coffeehouse chain and one of the most recognizable consumer brands in existence. In the US alone, Starbucks has nearly 9,000 corporate-owned stores, and not a single one of them is unionized … until now. After leading an organizing campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic and facing tireless efforts by the company to delay, deflate, and defeat union elections with the National Labor Relations Board, workers at three Starbucks locations in Buffalo, New York, submitted their ballots this week. After vote counting took place on Thursday, one of the three Buffalo stores, located on Elmwood Avenue, became the first unionized company-owned store in the US. Another store, located on Camp Road, voted against unionizing, and workers at the Genesee Street store in Cheektowaga appear to have voted “yes” on unionizing, but challenges to several votes are still being reviewed.  In this Working People mini-cast, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez talks with Brian Murray, one of the Buffalo Starbucks workers and organizers with SBWorkers United, and journalist Jordan Chariton, who recently traveled to Buffalo to speak with Starbucks workers and report on their fight for Status Coup.

As y’all heard, we’ve got a special and urgent mini cast for y’all today. I’m sure that folks who listen to this show are already aware that there’s some big stuff going down in Buffalo where workers at multiple Starbucks locations – We all know the coffee giant Starbucks that has almost 9,000 company-operated stores in the United States alone – It is a massive coffee chain and yet there have been no successful union campaign efforts at Starbucks stores in the United States. And that may be about to change. As you heard Brian mention, workers at multiple locations in Buffalo have been involved in a cutthroat union organizing campaign to form unions, and the company has been doing everything that it can to thwart those efforts. Even bringing out the former CEO Howard Schultz to come, and I don’t know, sweep the floors and say that, hey, we’re all a family here, and all that bullshit. But against all odds and against Starbucks trying to delay the union election, trying to upend the union election by saying that all the stores in the Buffalo area should be required to vote together as a single bargaining unit. That motion was struck down by the National Labor Relations board and that cleared the way for the current union election that is taking place right now as we speak to proceed. \n",

As Battleground Baltimore reported last week, for people who use drugs, their ability to use without fear of overdose has dramatically decreased in recent years, and decriminalizing paraphernalia such as syringes, needles, and cookers seriously reduces overdoses. That’s not speculation—it’s a fact.  Here’s another fact: There were over 100,000 fatal overdoses nationwide in 2020.  In Maryland, possession of paraphernalia used to inject drugs can mean as much as four years in prison—much more than drug possession, which can lead to up to one year in prison. \n",

      " Content: In 2014, at the age of 15, Prakash Churaman was arrested at his home at 6AM without a warrant. After driving him around for a few hours, police brought Churaman to the 113th Precinct and, as Churaman and his attorney maintain, coerced a confession out of him for a crime he did not commit. As reported in the Queens Daily Eagle, “Prosecutors say Churaman was one of the gunmen in a robbery gone wrong when Churaman, alongside two others, allegedly broke into his friend’s home and ended up fatally shooting [Taquane] Clark and injuring one other. An elderly woman who lived in the home during the robbery later told police that she recognized Churaman’s voice and identified him as one of the suspects. Her testimony, which is at the crux of the prosecution’s case, has been called into question by Churaman’s attorney.” Even after the court overturned Churaman’s conviction, he is still fighting to clear his name and is now facing a second trial after declining to take a plea deal. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway talks with Churaman and his attorney Jose Nieves about how the criminal justice system railroads juveniles into false confessions, and about the ongoing fight to get all charges against Churaman dropped. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:        Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. Recently, we have been looking at Rikers Island and the conditions up there. One case caught our attention, that’s the case of Prakash Churaman. And so today, joining me is Prakash Churaman and his lawyer Jose Nieves. Thanks for joining me. Jose Nieves:          Thank you for having us. Prakash is very happy to be here, and so am I. And we hope that this will be a productive discussion. Eddie Conway:             Okay. Let’s start with what happened, Prakash? How did you wind up in this predicament? Prakash Churaman:        NYPD came to my home, to my residence, at the age of 15, four days after an alleged crime took place two blocks away from where I lived at that time. And due to the fact that an elderly woman made claims that she recognized my voice, that gave NYPD probable cause to “apprehend me” and take me into custody. That was four days after this alleged crime took place. At approximately 6:00 AM in the morning I was apprehended in my basement apartment. I was living with my mother at the time in Jamaica, Queens. I think it was literally like – \n",

      " Content: Yes, we all have a certain nostalgic attachment to the Harry Potter series and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But let’s be honest: It’s a little odd that children are offered up as sacrifices in JK Rowling’s magical world, that they’re expected to save everybody, and that everyone is just kind of fine with that arrangement. However, in the first two installments of her celebrated Scholomance series, A Deadly Education and The Last Graduate, author Naomi Novik creates a much darker and much more violent world of magic, monsters, sorcerers, and survival—a world that takes the premise of Rowling’s series to a darker, more violent, and dramatically complex conclusion. Following the central character El as she navigates the treacherous world within and beyond the Scholomance, a school for sorcerers without teachers or a governing body, Novik’s innovative novels not only make for great reading but also probe deeply human and political questions about the choices we make to survive in a darkly unjust world—and the fights we must wage in order to create something better. In the newest episode of Art for the End Times, host Lyta Gold convenes a lively panel of writers, philologists, editors, and haters to discuss the Scholomance series and the important lessons Novik’s magical world can teach us about surviving our own monstrous world. Panelists include: Dan Walden, Allegra Silcox, Adrian Rennix, and Jessica Lam. Subscribe to the TRNN podcast on your favorite podcast player so you don’t miss an episode of Art for the End Times! Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Lyta Gold:      Hello, and welcome to Art for the End Times. I am your beloved host Lyta Gold. This week, we are bringing you a very special episode. Okay, yeah, they’re all very special episodes of course. But this one has an afterschool special vibe because we’re going to be talking about a magical school. So you’re thinking, oh, shit, it’s a Harry Potter episode. Okay, I would not do that to you guys. I wouldn’t. Fear not. We’re going to talk about a different series, a new series. It’s a trilogy by Naomi Novik. It’s called the Scholomance Series. The first two books are out. The first one is called A Deadly Education. The second one just came out, it’s called The Last Graduate. The third one’s supposed to come out next year. So the way I usually sell these books to people – Because I love Naomi Novik and I have a different pitch for every single book of hers – But for this series, the way I sell it to people, I say it’s like a dark Harry Potter. Or it’s like, what if Harry Potter was good instead of being super disappointing? So this series, the Scholomance Series, it’s about capitalism, it’s about inequality, it’s about our broken educational system, it’s about solidarity, it’s about friendship, [cars honking] it’s about horns beeping outside, and it’s about monsters. So to help us talk about this, I’ve brought on some of my absolute favorite monsters in the world. So let’s introduce them. First up, we have a writer, an academic, a philologist. He knows more than you. He’s read more than you. That’s right. It’s Dan Walden. Dan Walden:      Oh, hi, Lyta. It is wonderful to be on with you again. Lyta Gold:      I know. Same. And the next up we have got one of my very favorite people in the world. She’s a writer and a tech genius, a true nerd girl, so [fake] nerd boys can step it off. It’s Allegra Silcox. Allegra Silcox:     I didn’t even know who you were introducing for a second. Hello, it’s me. Lyta Gold:            Because you’re too modest. You’re a tech genius, and you say, that can’t be me. Allegra Silcox:      Can’t be me. Lyta Gold:         Right. or that can’t be me, even though I wrote a bunch of brilliant articles. Can’t be me. That’s you, that’s you. Allegra Silcox:     It’s me. Lyta Gold:         Our next person really needs no introduction at all. They’re a writer, an editor, a lawyer, a hero, a scholar. It’s Adrian Rennix. Adrian Rennix:     Hi, guys. Lyta Gold:      The face, you can’t see the face, but the face that Rennix just made was a work of art. Very last, but not least, a very good friend of mine, fantasy fan, higher ed professional, hater extraordinaire, it’s Jessica Lam. Jessica Lam:     I mean, when you say hater, it sounds unfair. It’s just a lot of things deserve it. You know what I mean? Lyta Gold:            That’s what makes you such a good hater, because you fairly apply the hate to the things that deserve it. Jessica Lam:     I’m an equal opportunity hater. Lyta Gold:             So yeah, we’re going to do a panel. But before we get going on the panel, a quick rundown of what the Scholomance books are about. We’re going to do a lot of spoilers if you haven’t read them. But just here’s the basic overview, if you haven’t read them at all. They’re definitely written – And Novik has said this – They’re written as sort of critique or reaction to Harry Potter. They also draw on this Eastern European legend I didn’t know about, a legend about a school of magic where Satan claims the soul of the last graduate to leave, which I don’t know how that works. If your name ends in Z, are you fucked? Is that how that … Who’s the last? Is it merit? I don’t know. I guess it depends on the school. Yeah, my husband’s name, we went to college together, his name ends in a Z. So he was always at the end. So I’m like, oh, God, would he be eaten by Satan? Dang, it would be rough. Sucks to be him, I guess. Anyway, the premise – Jessica Lam: It explains a lot. Lyta Gold:         I know. Right? It kind of does. Jessica does him well. The premise of this world is a little bit similar to Harry Potter. We’ve got a wizarding world that exists alongside the regular one, but this wizarding world is extremely dangerous. Magic is performed with mana, and mana is very tasty to monsters around the world, and there’s tons of monsters. The word for monsters in the book is Maleficaria, or it’s called mals for short. So we’ll use that. People who are most at risk from mals are wizard teens because they’re brimming with mana and they can’t really protect themselves. So the safest option, which is even safest even if you’re a wizard with a lot of resources and you live in a fancy enclave, you send your kids to the Scholomance. The school’s supposed to keep out the mals. Of course, plenty of mals get in, anyway. It’s not a great system. Graduation is extremely dangerous because a lot of mals just hang out in the graduation hall, waiting for the teens to run up and get eaten. So usually, only about a quarter of the class will make it out of the Scholomance alive. Everybody’s fine with that. I mean, they’re not fine, fine, but it’s like the best available option. It’s the lesser of two evils. It’s the best possible chance for the kids. So if you are from a wealthy enclave, your kid in the school, you will have more resources coming in, more allies. You’re more likely to make it. You’re more likely to survive. If you’re not rich, then you need to make some alliances with the rich kids or with some others or you’re fucked. You’re probably fucked anyway, if you’re not rich. So real quick, main characters just before we go into it. Protagonist is a poor kid whose name is El. It’s kind of a strange – So it’s short for Galadriel, which is like The Lord of the Rings character. It’s a little strange. I don’t know if Naomi Novik is trying to make it unadaptable for the screen, which I would extremely respect if that was the move. I also think that it puts El in this position of always being stuck in the moment of making this choice whether she’s going to be a good person or a powerful evil queen. Lyta Gold:          Different kinds of magic, like natural affinities, El’s affinity is for evil, dark sorcerous shit. She’s all about that. She doesn’t necessarily want to be all about that but the school gives her spells to make super volcanoes and just kill lots of people all the time. So that’s fun. She’s a lot of fun. She hates everybody, and I really like her. \n",

      " Content: In 1974, the population of Hortonville, Wisconsin, was around 1,500, and yet it became the site of one of the most contentious and consequential teachers’ strikes in the state’s history. In the end, over 80 striking educational staff members in the Hortonville district were fired by an intransigent school board, and the strike itself ripped the community in two. With teachers and their supporters on one side and a virulently anti-union school board, local police, and townspeople opposed to the strike on the other side, things got very ugly in Hortonville, and the legacy of the broken ‘74 strike left a deep scar on the town and the district for many years. Nearly 50 years after the Hortonville strike and 10 years after the passing of Act 10 under Republican Gov. Scott Walker, which was a hammer blow to public sector unions around the state, teachers in Hortonville are facing increased workloads, lower take-home pay, difficulties retaining educational staff, and greater obstacles to union organizing. As part of a special collaboration with In These Times magazine for The Wisconsin Idea, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez traveled to Wisconsin with Cameron Granadino (TRNN) and Hannah Faris (In These Times) to speak with teachers and organizers around the state about how Act 10 impacted their lives and work, and how they are rebuilding out of the rubble. In this interview, recorded at their home in Hortonville, Alvarez speaks with Amanda and Jeff Frenkel, two K-12 educators and organizers with the American Federation of Teachers who are fighting to rebuild the union in Hortonville and use the tools available to them to improve working conditions in the district.

CORRECTION 12/6/21: Amanda Frenkel is identified in this video as “High School Teacher & AFT Organizer” but should be identified as “Elementary School Teacher & AFT Organizer.” Maximillian Alvarez:    This is Maximillian Alvarez for The Real News Network and In These Times magazine reporting from Hortonville, Wisconsin, a small rural town with a population just shy of 3,000. In 1974 the population of Hortonville was around 1,500. And yet, it became the site of one of the most contentious and consequential teacher strikes in Wisconsin’s history. Over 80 striking educational staff members were fired by an intransigent school board and the strike itself ripped the community in two. Between teachers and their supporters, local police and townspeople opposed to the strike, things got very ugly here in Hortonville. And the legacy of the broken strike left a deep scar in the community for many years to come.  Nearly 50 years after the Hortonville teacher’s strike and 10 years after the passing of Act 10 under Republican Governor Scott Walker, which was a hammer blow to public sector unions around the state, teachers here are feeling the squeeze. I got to talk with Amanda and Jeff Frenkel, two K through 12 educators and AFT union organizers here in the Hortonville district, about the struggles they and their coworkers are facing and about the ways they are working together to rebuild. Amanda Frenkel:    I’m Amanda Frenkel, and I’ve been teaching for 22 years. 20 at Hortonville and two years out of state. And currently I’m teaching Spanish at the elementary level, which is amazing and fun. And I’m also a reading teacher, and I teach that in the afternoons. So I have students grades K through four. And Jeff? Jeff Frenkel:        I’m Jeff Frenkel. I, same – teaching 22 years, 20 at Hortonville, two out of state. I teach high school math. So I’ve been having a fun time doing that. And I also coach softball, and I’ve coached pretty much most sports. Amanda Frenkel:    And you’ve been coaching your entire career. He started coaching in college, coaching baseball. Jeff Frenkel:        – Baseball, and down in Missouri, coached football, coach football here and baseball and softball and basketball. Done it all. Maximillian Alvarez:    And yeah, I mean, right before we got here for this interview, you were at a game. Jeff Frenkel:        We were just at a game, we won 3 to 1. Maximillian Alvarez:    Boom. Nice. So you said you were, y’all were in Missouri before this. So I guess I’m curious if you’ve been teaching here for two decades, what was the path that brought you from Missouri over to Hortonville of all places? Amanda Frenkel:    Well, actually, after we graduated college we decided, let’s just go have some fun. So we were newly engaged and wanted to go out of state. So we literally seriously just applied to all the warm states and whichever states got back to us first that’s where we taught. And my rule was we need to be teaching in the same area together. So that was a dream of mine, to be in the same area together. And then we decided that when we were ready to settle down and start our family, we would find the perfect town. And so two years later, I was probably ready a little faster than you were, but so we need to go back home because our family’s up here a couple hours away. But Hortonville was the perfect match for us. Maximillian Alvarez: As a Southern Californian who’s lived in the Midwest, I can’t blame you for wanting to spend some time in a warmer part of the country. And I guess also, did y’all both know from an early stage that you wanted to be teachers? Is that how you two met? Amanda Frenkel:    Yeah. I always knew I was going to be a teacher. I was helping out in high school at the elementary and did all those kinds of things, and did daycare and babysitting. But when we were in… We went to University of Eau Claire, we met during our teacher education classes. Maximillian Alvarez:    Give me more of that story. Who put the moves on whom? Jeff Frenkel:         It was actually one of our friends who hooked us up together. Amanda Frenkel:     One of our dear friends who teaches in Menominee. We had a class, we had a winter class because we were that studious that we took classes all summer and in the winter, during the winter and January classes. And his friend Chad said, you guys like each other just go out already. I’ve always felt like every day for three weeks in this class together. So finally the last day we went out on a date and that’s history. So he takes all the credit for hooking us up because I don’t know if we would have said much to each other. Maximillian Alvarez:    That’s cute. You said that you all have family in the northern part of Wisconsin. \n",

      " Content: “After years of hypocrisy and bungled forecasts of doom, the budget deficit no longer provokes panic,” economist Max Sawicky recently wrote in In These Times. “The elites need a new bogeyman, otherwise Congress might actually spend us into happiness. Now, the new monster in the closet is Inflation.” With all eyes on President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan, which would entail massive and sorely needed social investments in education, healthcare, childcare, clean energy, and more, a familiar chorus of budgetary hand-wringers has emerged to argue that such social spending is the cause of increased inflation. As Sawicky argues, that’s nonsense. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc and Sawicky break down the current levels of inflation and discuss the political motivations behind the moral panic over inflation, which is essentially a new form of old-school deficit hawkery.

      " Content: Back in January 2020, before the pandemic, then-City Council President (now Mayor) Brandon Scott introduced a resolution that called for an informational hearing about “overdose prevention sites”—places where people can use drugs safely without having to worry about arrest. There are more than 100 of these sites around the world, and no one has ever fatally overdosed at one of them. Currently, there are very few in the United States. Rhode Island intends to launch a pilot site and New York City opened two sites in Manhattan this week.  “If the state or the law department or someone else doesn’t think the council has the authority to authorize [overdose prevention sites], then we’ll have the discussion,” Scott told me at the time. “Saving the lives of Baltimoreans is worth the risk of making some other government body mad or running the risk of having to defend why we want to save lives.” Despite ongoing advocacy from the BRIDGES Coalition (Baltimore Resources for Indoor Drug-use Grassroots Education and Safety) and vocal support from Mayor Scott and Baltimore City States’ Attorney Marilyn Mosby, further movement on overdose prevention sites in Baltimore has been slow moving. In the meantime, Mosby announced her office would no longer prosecute Baltimoreans for drug possession. The results are notable. In 2019, there were 3,770 arrests for drug offenses, according to the Baltimore Police. In 2020, there were 1,348 arrests. What was originally introduced as a temporary policy during the start of the pandemic has continued. \n",

In this episode, the Police Accountability Report investigates the incident and exposes flaws in the system of police accountability in Arizona that reveal just how difficult it is to create effective systems of police oversight. Taya Graham:        Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to do so by reporting on breaking developments in a story we have been investigating for months. It involves an Arizona State Highway Patrol officer accusing a motorist of a crime he didn’t commit and then ordering him to risk his life for no apparent reason. But we’re not just going to be discussing what happened on this disturbing video. We will also be giving you, our viewers, a peek behind the curtains on how police respond after we publish a report and what they do to justify their actions when their overreach is called into question. But before we get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. You know I read your comments and appreciate them. And of course you can always reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore or Facebook or Twitter. And we have a special thank you shout out to our patrons at the end of this episode. And if you would like to be one, just hit the Patreon donate link pinned in the comments below. All right, now we’ve gotten all that out of the way. Now, for those of you who watch our show, you might already be familiar with the segment of our program when we perform what we consider a basic function of journalism. That is, no matter how bizarre, odd, or seemingly corrupt the actions of a particular officer or department are, we always extend the courtesy of asking them for comment to tell their side of the story. Why? Well, as much as law enforcement does quite the opposite when they paint a victim of brutality or false arrest in the harshest light possible, we simply believe that the tenets of basic journalism are too important to cast aside regardless of a story. I mean, what’s the point of reporting on an institution like law enforcement if you behave exactly like them? What I mean is you can’t hold an institution accountable if you are not accountable yourself. Therefore, whenever possible, we always reach out to cops and extend them the courtesy of giving them an opportunity to tell their side. Of course, keeping with their tradition of a maximum of institutional arrogance, cops and their spokespeople certainly don’t make it easy for us to follow through even when we try to adhere to the basic principles and ethics of journalism. In other words, regardless of how many times we reach out for comment, our efforts are usually met with silence. At least until we publish our report. But I’ll elaborate on that more later. \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Labor Notes on Dec. 1, 2021. It is shared here with permission. The members of the United Auto Workers appear to have voted overwhelmingly to move to a direct voting system for choosing their union leadership—“one member, one vote.” As of this afternoon, with more than two-thirds of the votes counted, direct elections had the support of 63%. If the result holds, it will be a historic win for reformers in one of the nation’s most important unions, where members have pushed for this change for decades. The referendum is the product of a consent decree between the UAW and the US Department of Justice, after a years-long series of prosecutions of top union officials on corruption charges ranging from embezzling union funds for personal use to accepting bribes from an employer, FCA (formerly Chrysler, now Stellantis), in exchange for accepting contract terms more favorable for the company. One million members were eligible to vote in the mail-ballot referendum, including 400,000 active members and 600,000 retirees. Of those, 143,000 returned ballots. By the Numbers As of noon today, there were 45 locals where more than 500 voters had cast a ballot. A majority voted for direct elections in 42 of these 45 locals. Overall, one member, one vote has so far received majority support in 178 locals, often overwhelmingly. In 53 locals—mostly smaller ones—members have voted in favor of retaining the delegate system, but usually only narrowly. Seven locals were evenly split. \n",

      " Content: Around 800 teachers and paraprofessionals in President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, started off the month of November by going on strike. Workers hit the picket line on Wednesday, Nov. 3, over budget cuts and low pay, as well as cuts to Pre-K, libraries, music and art programs, and the closure of an elementary school (with other closures anticipated).  “We’ve finally had enough as they continue to cut opportunities for our students,” said Adam McCormick, a 9th- and 10th-grade English teacher in Scranton. “As they continue to cut programs and try to cut teachers and put more and more on teachers’ plates, we came to a tipping point that we just couldn’t stand by and watch those things be taken from our students.” McCormick noted that teachers’ wages in Scranton lag behind pay rates in surrounding districts, and around 15%of teachers have left the school district in the past 18 months, not including retirements.  In response to the strike, the school district cancelled workers’ health insurance, but teachers and their union rallied support from the community and elected officials, eventually winning a tentative agreement on Nov. 19.  From “the great resignation” and “the great reassessment of work” to “Striketober” and “Strikesgiving,” workers around the US are fighting back against employers pushing for more concessions and cuts. \n",

D saw to it that he and his friends were as safe as possible—he’s more fastidious and more experienced than the others. Heroin had been part of his life for about 20 years. “I’ve been using off and on,” D explained to me. “Mostly on.” Most mornings back then, D and his friends looked out for one another because they understood that they were most likely to overdose when they used alone. If no one’s there with you, no one’s there to save you.  In Baltimore, there were 1028 fatal overdoses in 2020, more than double the number of murders. Nationally, there were more than 100,000 fatal overdoses in 2020. In case anybody did overdose, D was ready with Naloxone, the medicine that blocks the effects of opioids and reverses overdose. He gripped the small nasal spray bottles of NARCAN and got a little less jokey with me. “Life savers, man,” he said. \n",

On Nov. 19, 2021, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi finally declared his willingness to repeal the three farm bills that had provoked a yearlong protest action by more than one hundred thousand farmers and agricultural laborers. The farmers’ struggle against pauperization and the corporatization of agriculture cost more than 700 lives as it faced massive state repression, including arrests, physical violence, and frequent internet shutdowns. After eleven rounds of unsuccessful negotiations with the government, the movement forced Modi to retreat. In the seven years since Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) returned to power, they have usually responded to democratic dissent with brutal repression and violence by Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) vigilantes rather than pull back from their legislative plans. The protests against the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the anti-Muslim Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 bore witness to this trend. \n",

After rank-and-file members rejected the tentative agreement between the university and the bargaining committee, negotiations continued. However, Columbia has still failed to meet key demands, including better wages, dental and vision healthcare coverage, and third-party arbitration for cases involving harassment and discrimination. Now, Student Workers of Columbia are back on strike and have been on the picket line since Nov. 3. In this mini-cast, we talk with three graduate student workers, Joanna Lee, Tamara Hache, and Caroline Smith, about the current strike and how academic workers are an essential part of the labor movement. Additional links/info below… Featured Music (all songs sourced from the Free Music Archive at freemusicarchive.org): Jules Taylor, “Working People Theme Song” Joanna:        Hi, I’m Joanna. I’m a PhD student at Columbia university and I’m an organizer with our student worker union, Student Workers of Columbia. Caroline:             And I’m Caroline. And I’m also a PhD student at Columbia University and I’m helping to organize, and you’ll also find me on the picket line as a captain. Tamara:             Hi, I’m Tamara. I’m a fourth year PhD student worker at Columbia University and also involved in organizing with our union SWC. Maximillian Alvarez:    All right. Well, welcome everyone to another episode of Working People, a podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network, produced by Jules Taylor, and supported entirely by listeners like you. So, as y’all heard, we’ve got an urgent mini-cast for y’all today. Listeners to the show have probably heard. Just because striketober ended does not mean that workers’ demands have all been met. Far from it. And in fact, there is a crucial ongoing strike happening right now with student workers at Columbia University in New York. And we are honored to be joined by this panel to basically give us the rundown on what’s going on with the strike, what the university’s response has been, what workers demands are, and why, for God’s sake, the university is refusing to meet them. And folks may remember – You’re not having deja vu – But back in March, we actually had Joanna from this panel along with comrades Harlan Chambers and Cameron Foltz on the show. That mini-cast was called Columbia Is a Bully where we talked about a strike that was happening then in March and some really important negotiations between the union and the university and we broke all that down. So I would encourage folks listening to this, if you want some deeper background here, you should go back and re-listen to that episode because I thought Joanna, Harlan, and Cameron gave a really great summary of all the important issues that were on the table. And I figured what we would do here by way of giving listeners all the information that they need about the current strike is pick up where we left off in March and walk folks through what’s been happening since we recorded them to now, both on the union side, on the university side. \n",

      " Content: According to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center, even though they have doubts about its administration, fairness, and usefulness as a crime deterrent, most Americans today still support the death penalty. Moreover, while it may seem like a brutal relic of a bygone era, capital punishment is still legal in 24 states, for the federal government, and for the military. As John Gramlich writes, “while state-level executions have decreased” in recent decades, “the federal government put more prisoners to death under President Donald Trump than at any point since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.” Sister Helen Prejean has spent much of her life as a Catholic nun bearing witness to the violent inhumanity of state executions and campaigning to abolish the death penalty. Her work has been recognized around the world, including by the Pope, and has been instrumental in advancing national dialogue on capital punishment and in shaping the Catholic Church’s vigorous opposition to all executions. She is also the author of Dead Man Walking: An Eyewitness Account of the Death Penalty in the United States, The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions, and River of Fire: On Becoming an Activist. In this special episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway sits down to speak with Sister Prejean about the barbarous injustice of state-sanctioned executions and her own path to becoming a leading advocate for death penalty abolition. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:        Welcome to this episode of Rattling The Bars. Today, we are going to look at a champion of the death penalty abolishment. Today, we have a guest, a special guest. I’m honored, in fact, to have her. Sister Helen Prejean. She’s the author of Dead Man Walking, which they made a film out of. She is also an author of several other books, but what’s fascinating about her is that she has spent a lifetime as a nun campaigning to abolish the death penalty. So, Sister Helen, thank you for joining me. Sister Helen Prejean:    Eddie, hey, am I glad to be with you. You’re the real thing. You’re the real thing, Eddie. Eddie Conway:            Okay. Sister Helen, give us a little just overview right now of where in the United States the death penalty is. I noticed that there was only a few states that actually overwhelmed the death penalty system, but where’s the death penalty being practiced at now, in the United States? Sister Helen Prejean:       This will not surprise you. It’s the former Confederate states, the slave states, which have done, since the death penalty was put back in ’76, over 70% of all actual executions. So where they’ve taken place now, you look at Texas, of course, Florida, Oklahoma. Oklahoma is just revving up that killing machine again. They just killed John Grant. They have botched three executions, they’re still killing them. \n",

And many around the world were left angry and disillusioned when the conference seemed to culminate in a lot of sincere-sounding rhetoric, empty promises, and unenforceable measures from the world’s worst polluters, including the United States. As Dharna Noor recently wrote for The Boston Globe, “Leaders at the Glasgow talks made some bold pledges in the meeting’s final agreement, but no one can make them keep those promises. The United Nations has no power to enforce compliance, and there are no penalties for breaking pacts.” What’s worse, Noor continues, “According to a report by advocacy groups including Global Witness and Corporate Accountability, more than 500 lobbyists and executives with ties to oil, gas, and coal companies attended [COP26], either as members of trade associations or as part of countries’ official delegations.” In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc and Noor discuss what the proceedings at COP26 tell us about the seriousness of the climate crisis and the inadequacy of the methods we’re using to combat it. They also discuss Noor’s recent article about the Biden administration overseeing the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in US history. Dharna Noor is The Boston Globe‘s climate producer. Prior to joining the Globe‘s climate team, Noor worked as a staff writer at Earther, Gizmodo‘s climate vertical, where she also co-produced a season of the podcast Drilled on the fossil fuel industry’s influence on education.

      " Content: Last week, Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby—who is fundraising to defend himself in a federal investigation—unveiled a dollar houses program that his office claims will revitalize the city and bridge its massive racial wealth gap. The legislation allows certain Baltimoreans to rent a vacant home for two years for just $1 while they make necessary repairs. Once the formerly vacant home is livable, the title goes to the $1 renter.  The need for cheaper homes is apparent in Baltimore. Longtime city residents have been locked out of opportunities to create wealth that homeownership provides—and median sale prices in Baltimore have nearly doubled since January 2020. [Housing advocates and even some investors] say Mosby’s legislation is duplicative of policies already in place and warn that, if previous attempts at this program are any indication, the program would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and real estate developers. “Besides the opportunity to create generational wealth, buying an affordable home will also save many city renters hundreds of dollars a month,” a press release from the council president’s office said. “Nearly half of the renters in Baltimore pay more than a third of their income on housing.” Many housing advocates, and even some investors, are suspicious. They say Mosby’s legislation is duplicative of policies already in place and warn that, if previous attempts at this program are any indication, the program would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and real estate developers. Housing Our Neighbors, a grassroots membership organization that fights for affordable housing and the rights of those facing housing precarity and eviction in Baltimore, called Mosby’s dollar homes program “a PR move.” \n",

      " Content: In the years following the Great Recession, Republican Gov. Scott Walker led an all-out assault on unions and public sector workers in Wisconsin. In response, teachers, students, farmers, and workers of all stripes descended on the state Capitol, engaging in one of the largest sustained protest actions in US history, now known as the Wisconsin Uprising. When the dust settled, however, Walker and the Republican legislature succeeded in passing Act 10, which was a devastating blow to the labor movement that essentially stripped collective bargaining rights for public sector workers, made it much more difficult for workers to organize, and forced unions to take massive concessions on healthcare, retirement benefits, and much more. Soon after, in 2015, Walker signed legislation that turned Wisconsin into a “right to work” state, issuing another blow to unions in a state once heralded as a bellwether of progressive politics and the labor movement. As part of a special collaboration with In These Times magazine for The Wisconsin Idea, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez traveled to Wisconsin with Cameron Granadino (TRNN) and Hannah Faris (In These Times) to speak with teachers and organizers around the state about how Act 10 impacted their lives and work, and how they are rebuilding out of the rubble. In this interview, recorded at the Racine Labor Center, Alvarez speaks with retired teacher and lifelong organizer Al Levie about the devastating impacts of the right-wing war on workers and public education, the historic grassroots struggle that took place during the Uprising, and how multiracial, multi-generational, student-led coalitions in places like Racine are carrying on that fighting spirit 10 years later.

Maximillian Alvarez:    This is Maximillian Alvarez for the Real News Network and In These Times magazine reporting from Racine, Wisconsin. As part of our special collaboration with In These Times to investigate the changing political terrain in the state of Wisconsin, I’ve been talking with teachers and organizers around the state about the trajectory of the labor movement in Wisconsin, especially after the coordinated assault on workers and unions that turned Wisconsin into a right to work state and that stripped public sector workers of their collective bargaining rights with the passing of Act 10 under Republican Governor Scott Walker 10 years ago. In the Racine Labor Center behind me, I got to sit down with retired teacher and longtime organizer Al Levie to talk about these assaults on the working class and about how workers, students, and communities are working to rebuild power and bring progressive change back to Wisconsin. Al Levie:                I’m Al Levie, a retired teacher. I was active in the teachers union. I’m currently in a transitional role as the organizing director for Voces De La Frontera. I have been doing that for two years. Maximillian Alvarez:    Oh yeah. Well, Al it’s really a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for sitting down with me, man. For folks watching, this is part of our expansive collaboration here at the Real News with In These Times for their project, The Wisconsin Idea, which is really looking into the changing politics and economics of Wisconsin, especially in rural areas, but not exclusively. One of the big stories that we’ve been investigating on this shoot is how public sector workers, especially teachers, are faring 10 years after the passing of Act 10. How people are organizing on the ground to build out of the rubble that was left by Scott Walker and the legislature, so on and so forth. I wanted to talk to you a bit about that Al, but before we get there, I wanted to get to know more about you. Could you talk to us about, I guess, your path to becoming a teacher? Are you originally from Wisconsin? \n",

      " Content: What role does fiction have to play in the class struggle? Should the left be making a stronger case for the political importance of reading literature? In this special Working People episode, which has been months in the making, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez talks with writer and editor Sarah Lazare about her novel Testimony, which she co-authored with her late father, Peter Lazare. Testimony is a leftist crime thriller that takes place in Springfield, Illinois, at the height of the “war on terror” panic in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. It is also a deeply moving story about trust, commitment to everyday people, and fighting the corrupt, self-serving, and nefarious forces that weaponize fear for their own gain. As the back cover of the book describes, “Testimony isn’t about One Great Man taking on the system, but about one okay, flawed person working with a rag-tag team of other okay, flawed people to combat a system of cynicism and greed much bigger than them.” In this deep and wide-ranging conversation, Alvarez talks with Lazare about the book itself, about her father and the long process of getting the book ready for publication, and about the important role genre fiction has to play in our collective fight for a better world. This episode also features segments of dramatic readings from Testimony performed by Alvarez, Lazare, and friends of the show Adam Johnson (Citations Needed) and Mel Buer (Morning Riot). And a special thanks to Working People producer Jules Taylor for all his hard work editing the episode!

My name is Maximillian Alvarez, and we’ve got a really special treat for y’all today. Now, this episode has been months in the making and I am so excited to finally share it with you guys. So I’m going to try to keep this intro short and sweet, so we can get right to the good stuff. Back in July, I got the chance to be on an incredible panel for a very special book launch event that was titled “Why The Left Should Engage Fiction: A Conversation With Radical Thriller And Mystery Writers.” I mean, I was just honored to join these accomplished writers like Aia Deleon, Bill Fletcher Jr., and Kate Rafael to collectively come together and celebrate and discuss a brilliant new novel by none other than Sarah Lazare, a dear friend of the show and in real life. And the book was also by her late father, Peter Lazare. Now, I have just a million and one lovely things to say about Sarah and the incredible work that she does as a writer and web editor for In These Times and about this novel, which is called Testimony. But I do spend a good deal of our conversation in today’s episode embarrassing Sarah and heaping praise on her and this book. So I’ll spare you guys from having to hear that twice in one episode, but suffice it to say that Sarah is truly an incredible, brilliant, compassionate person whom I’ve been honored to get to work with throughout the time that Working People has been partnered with In These Times. And suffice it to say that you should absolutely check out Sarah and her father Peter’s book Testimony, which is not only good leftist noir thriller fiction that takes place in Springfield, Illinois, at the height of the war on terror panic 20 years ago, but it’s also just good fiction, period. You guys know that before I was doing this podcast, before I started working at The Real News, I was, and always will be, an unapologetic literature nerd. Reading and discussing literature has always been my favorite thing in the world to do. And it’s really depressed me, frankly, that over the past few years, my career in media has basically given me way less time to do it. And you can get so consumed by your day to day work and you can go so long without reading a full piece of literary fiction or nonfiction that you can actually start to forget how much you love it and why you love it so much. And that is why I am just so eternally grateful to Sarah and Peter, because they gave me a really special gift. Honestly, reading their book and getting a chance to discuss it with Sarah for this special episode, helped me fall back in love with literature again. And I hope that this episode can help others reconnect, or connect for the first time, with the joy of reading and thinking. Because, as I hope Sarah and I make a strong case for, both of those things are pretty important for surviving this harsh world and remaining committed to building a better one. So on that note, let’s go on ahead and get to today’s super special Working People episode which features an incredibly stimulating conversation that I got to have with Sarah about her book and about the role of genre fiction in the class struggle. So, see, it’s not just that I wanted to talk about this book, but there is a lot of connective tissue there with the stuff that we talk about every week here on Working People. And if that wasn’t good enough, this episode also features segments of dramatic readings from Testimony that were done by none other than yours truly, by Sarah, by her husband, the great Adam Johnson from Citations Needed, and the wonderful journalist and host of the excellent podcast Morning Riot, Mel Buer. You know, I had so much fun doing these dramatic readings and I want to give a huge shout out and express my sincere gratitude to Sarah, Adam, and Mel for doing them with me and for being such great sports about it. And of course, all the praise in the world needs to go to our amazing producer, Jules Taylor, for taking so much time and care to edit this episode and turn it into something truly special. And it goes without saying that this episode is dedicated to the late great Peter Lazare and his loving daughter, Sarah. This is their story. Sarah Lazare:        Hi, my name is Sarah Lazare. I am a reporter and web editor for In These Times, and I am also the co-author of the left-wing political noir book, Testimony. I co-authored it with my father, Peter Lazare. Maximillian Alvarez:  Well, Sarah, I am so excited that we were finally able to do this. I’ve read your and your father’s amazing novel that you just mentioned, Testimony, which is out right now with Strong Arm Press. And we figured that we would release this fun, special episode complete with exciting dramatic readings from sections of the book around the 20th anniversary of 9/11 because the book itself actually takes place in the wake of 9/11, and the noir kind of uses that background, I think, in a really compelling way. And it becomes a very interesting part of the plot and the characters’ motivations and all that good stuff. But we’re going to dig into that in a little bit, but I’ll start by saying to everyone out there, if you were looking for something to read, you should absolutely go buy Sarah’s book. Again, it’s called Testimony. It’s a novel. I actually had the honor of joining Sarah and a number of other brilliant writers for the book launch event where we talked about why the left needs to take genre fiction seriously, like all the beautiful and important things that genre fiction can do for left political imagination, all the importance that fiction has in politics. And it was one of the most invigorating discussions that I’ve had in a long time, and I thank Sarah for inviting me for that. And so I wanted to really then bring Sarah onto this show to talk about the book itself. There’s a really interesting backstory to how Sarah and her father put this book together, but also for Working People listeners. You guys know that I’m a big literature nerd, you know where my politics are, and you obviously know what this show is about. And I think that Sarah and Peter’s book actually fits really, really well into that crosshair. So I think that everyone who listens in to this show will really, really enjoy this book. And I hope that you’ll really enjoy our conversation with Sarah today about it, about left fiction, and all that good stuff. So, Sarah, I don’t want to go on too much because we’re really here to talk to you and learn from you about this book and what you wanted to accomplish with it. So I wanted to maybe give listeners that background story, because you and I have talked about how this book came to be in the world, but listeners may just be hearing about it for the first time. So could you give us, I guess, in the storytelling vein, could you give us the origin story of this book? Sarah Lazare:     Absolutely, I’d be happy to. And also, Max, thank you so much for those kind words. It means a lot. This book is very, very dear to me and the level of engagement you’ve had with it has just been so tremendously appreciated so, really, thank you. Yeah. So my father, Peter Lazare, before he passed away in 2018, he wrote the first draft of Testimony. And I spent the two years following his death adding to and editing the manuscript, really viewing it as a writing collaboration. And the result is a radical political noir that’s a combination of both of our politics and both of our voices. And I tried to continue some of the political conversations that we had when my dad was alive. My dad and I were really close, and my dad was a really interesting person. He was very involved in the radical movements of the seventies and the eighties, he protested the Vietnam war. He was a labor organizer and he was part of the back to the factory re-industrialization era of the socialist movement. So in the late seventies and early eighties he worked in a garment factory in Chicago as part of the Socialist Workers Party, as part of a deliberate effort to send members into factories in order to organize workers. And that was a very intense, very challenging process for my dad. He ended up getting really burnt out and then ended up getting a job, so he ended up stepping away from movement and deciding that he didn’t necessarily believe in it anymore, or believe that that particular corner of it was on the right path. And then he ended up getting a job as a utilities regulator in Springfield, Illinois, after. It wasn’t an immediate process, there were a few other steps in between, but the whole family wound up in Springfield, Illinois, where my dad was working as a utilities regulator. He did that for 20 years and had a lot of critical reflections on the corporate capture of the Illinois Commerce Commission where he worked, and a lot of critical reflections on this general culture of subservience to companies. I want to be clear that wasn’t the only thing he was doing at the time. He co-owned a coffee shop with my mom called Grab a Java. He always found ways to be thinking and writing and politically engaged, but he always really struggled with unresolved questions about, is a better world possible? He never lost his critique of capitalism and society, but he really struggled with, well, what is it we’re fighting for and what can we create? And then the maybe four or five years before he passed away, he started working extremely hard on a novel. He would go to the library and just sit for hours and hours. And my dad was always really good at trying new things and taking big risks, and this was definitely one of those circumstances where he did that. And he wrote this amazing draft that I then got to work with after he passed away. So that’s my roundabout way of explaining how the project came to be. Maximillian Alvarez:    Man. It’s really incredible to hear, especially for anyone who’s read the book because as we’ll talk about, and I guess to give listeners like the back of the cover synopsis… I might as well just read it right now, actually. So now, after you heard Sarah’s description of her father and how Peter came to write this book, here’s what the back of the book actually says. “It’s 2002, the height of the war on terror panic, and Sam, a lifelong left-wing radical, has had enough. He finally decides to stow his black ski mask and move to the uneventful mid-size city of Springfield, Illinois, to settle down and sell out as a gas utility regulator. His plans to coast and collect check, however, are complicated when the pipe of a major gas provider he’s tasked with overseeing explodes, killing a school janitor and sending an overfunded security apparatus into full-on John Milius mode, looking for terrorists who aren’t there and using ‘homeland authority’ to mask their self dealing. \n",

In this episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with Charles Hopkins, better known as Mansa Musa, about the historic occasion of Gilbert and Shoatz’s release and the reasons for their imprisonment. Conway and Hopkins are both former Black Panthers and longtime political prisoners who engaged in radical organizing and education programs while locked up. While reflecting on the historical climate in which they, Gilbert, Shoatz, and a generation of radicals were killed or imprisoned in the 1960s and ‘70s, Hopkins and Conway also offer advice to today’s social justice activists on the imperatives of community organizing and the continuing threat posed by the draconian apparatus of state repression. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. Recently, two political prisoners have been released: David Gilbert and Russell Maroon Shoatz have served decades in the American prison system. So joining me today to give us an update on their situation and who they were is Charles Hopkins, better known as Mansa Musa, who also was a former political prisoner. Charles, thanks for joining me. Mansa Musa:     Thanks for having me, Ed. Eddie Conway:     Okay, Mansa, could you just talk a little bit about each one of those political prisoners first? You can start with whichever one you want. Mansa Musa:          Right. Thank you. First of all I want to acknowledge that this is a good and a great opportunity for us to finally see some political prisoners released alive and not have to write their obituary and attend their funeral. Even though in the case of Maroon, he was released, which I’ll start with. He was released, what they call compassion leave. But the concept of compassion leave coming out of prison is that you’re going to die. They’re not going to release you unless they emphatically know that you are going to die. I researched this for a guy when I was in my own prison system, on compassion leave and that’s what it said. It said that the diagnosis is that the person that’s being released is going to die. \n",

      " Content: Even with majorities in both the House and Senate, conservative Democrats fought and removed parts of the Build Back Better plan that were wildly popular with voters—voters who elected Democrats expecting them to deliver things like paid leave, universal pre-K, and expanded Medicare coverage. As those voters continue to face real struggles, what options do they have when their representatives won’t even defend their agenda against members of their own party?  On this episode of The Marc Steiner Show, longtime labor organizer Bill Fletcher Jr. and Jacobin staff writer Luke Savage discuss how voters need to organize and counterattack with litigation, ballot initiatives, and mass action to confront voter suppression and gerrymandering, and pressure Democrats into action—and not just wait until midterm elections “for the meteor to hit.” Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Monday and Thursday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s good to have you all with us once again. Today, we have another conversation inspired by Jacobin magazine. For a few political moments, many of us took a sigh of relief when Trump lost the election and two progressives won Senate seats from Georgia that allowed Democrats to regain control of the Senate. Well, so much for that. The Democrats have just passed a watered down infrastructure and Build Back Better bills. Most Americans have no idea what the fight was about, but see Democrats in dysfunction. Democrats are in real danger of losing the House and the Senate during the next midterm elections, and they just lost the governor’s race in Virginia, and almost lost in New Jersey. One of our guests, Luke Savage, staff writer for Jacobin magazine, for which he wrote the article, “Democrats Can’t Be Losing Because They ‘Moved Too Far Left’ When They Aren’t Moving Left.” He joins us along with Bill Fletcher, who has been a union activist and organizer for decades, senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, written numerous books including his mystery novel, The Man Who Fell From The Sky, They’re Bankrupting Us, and many other books. The question is, what has this congressional battle wrought? Progressives among Democrats pushed hard and fought, but Senators Sinema and Manchin fought openly for the agendas of their corporate backers. The compromise cut legislation from $3 trillion to $1.5 trillion. So what does it all mean and what comes next? We’re going to explore that. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to have you both with us. Bill Fletcher:        Good to be on board. Luke Savage:        Glad to be here, thanks for having me. Marc Steiner:       Oh, this is great. Luke, let me just start with you since we started with your article. Give us a broad thesis here about what you’re positing. Luke Savage:         Okay. Well, the catalyst for the article was the elections a few weeks ago, which you mentioned off the top there. I mean, particularly the election in Virginia, in which the Democrats lost the gubernatorial election. Which has obviously become, in its own way, a catalyst for, I suppose, recurrence, resurgence of a Clinton era ontology of electoral politics that you’ve been really hearing from mainstream and centrist Democrats since the mid ’90s. Blame the left is a shorthand for it. In the centrist ontology of politics, the left is always to blame for defeat even when it’s not in power, even when it’s not really exerting influence, when it’s not in charge. And triangulation of one kind or another is always the cause of a centrist victory. \n",

Racial justice advocates reacted with outrage and a complete lack of surprise Friday after a Kenosha, Wisconsin jury found Illinois teenager Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges for killing two men and wounding a third during a 2020 protest against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, with some observers asserting that the verdict encourages vigilante attacks on protestors. “Judge Bruce Schroeder presented a case study in how the judiciary upholds systems of white supremacy. And he’s no anomaly.” Rejecting the prosecution’s assertion that “you cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create,” the nearly all-white jury acquitted Rittenhouse, who was 17 years old when he shot and killed Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle on August 25, 2020. \n",

      " Content: This week, City Council President Nick Mosby—who is fundraising to defend himself in a federal investigation—unveiled a dollar houses program that aims to revitalize the city and bridge its massive racial wealth gap. Critics warn it would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and real estate developers. Others noted that many aspects of the program are duplicative of policies already in place. “$25,000, depending on what property you buy, is not enough. Most of these houses need new floors, you probably still have lead paint … You have to rip out the entire house and put it back together.” The proposal to sell city-owned vacant homes for a dollar is intended to incentivize home ownership, targeting formerly redlined neighborhoods in East and West Baltimore and offering up to $10,000 towards their purchase and up to $25,000 for repairs. Mosby is calling on Mayor Brandon Scott to use a third of the $641 million Baltimore has received in American Rescue Plan Act funding for the plan. For Marc Rollins, a Baltimore-based real estate investor who has handled vacant properties for the last three years, Mosby’s numbers just don’t add up.  \n",

      " Content: In 2017, Ismail Ziada filed a civil suit at the District Court of the Hague against former Israeli military leaders Benny Gantz and Amir Eshel for their role in a 2014 strike—part of the Israeli offensive in Gaza known as Operation Protective Edge—which killed six of Ziada’s family members. In 2020, the court dismissed Ziada’s civil suit, arguing that, as agents of the state, Gantz and Eshel enjoy functional immunity from prosecution, and the court had no jurisdiction over the matter. Now, the Dutch court hearing his appeal has until Dec. 7 to decide whether the international legal principle of universal jurisdiction will allow him to pursue his case from the Netherlands, an enormous step forward for Palestinians trying to seek justice in Israel, where they’re prohibited from addressing cases or appeals against Israel for war crimes and acts of war. TRNN contributor David Kattenburg talks to Ziada’s lawyer, Liesbeth Zegveld,  about this case and what it could mean for those seeking international justice by way of local jurisdictions. Post-Production: Adam Coley David Kattenburg:    Hello and welcome to The Real News Network. I’m David Kattenburg. Here’s a story rooted in events back in the summer of 2014. On July 8 of that year, Israel launched a 51-day assault on Gaza, codenamed Operation Protective Edge. Over 2000 Gazans were killed, including over 500 children, and more than 10,000 were injured. And named among those lives the Israeli defense forces extinguished that horrific July day, the mother, three brothers, sister-in-law, and nephew of a Palestinian man named Ismail Ziada. Ismail holds Dutch nationality. In 2017, he filed a civil suit at the district court of the Hague against those he deemed responsible for the death of his family. Israel’s military chief at the time, Benny Gantz, and Amir Eshel, the man who commanded the fighter jet that demolished the building where Ismail’s family lived. In 2020, the district court of the Hague dismissed Ismail’s civil suit, arguing that Gantz and Eshel enjoy functional immunity from prosecution as agents of the state of Israel at the time of the events in 2014. The court also suggested that it did not have jurisdiction in the matter. \n",

      " Content: Traffic stops lead to fraught encounters with American law enforcement, which is why this stop between a LA County Sheriff and a local cop watcher is so illustrative of the power of turning the camera around on police. In this episode of the Police Accountability Report, we break down what happened and explore how the techniques used by cop watchers can actually prevent police from making questionable arrests. Post-Production: Adam Coley Taya Graham:         Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we’re going to start today by showing a video of a police encounter after a Los Angeles man was pulled over for a red light infraction. But how this story unfolds is so unusual and so outside the norm for police behavior, we’re going to break it down in detail, and why we think it might be an indicator of how cop watchers are more important than ever. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com and we might be able to investigate for you. And of course you can always message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook and Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us. And if you can, hit the Patreon donate button pinned in the comment below, because we do have some special goodies for our PAR family. Okay, now we’ve gotten all that out of the way. Now, if there is one maxim that has been repeated by all cop watchers we have interviewed on our show, it is a rule that can be expressed in three simple words: record, record, record. It’s a concept that reporting has certainly confirmed can be quite effective at documenting police overreach. Unfortunately for some of the people who have used it, the end result has been a little less encouraging. Meaning, even when cops are caught on camera, they usually don’t have a problem executing a brutal and sometimes even shocking arrest. Let’s remember this scene when First Amendment auditor, David Bourne, was filming police at an accident in Texas. Even though he was clearly exercising his First Amendment rights, cops didn’t have a problem arresting him for reasons that still remain unclear. Let’s watch. David Bourne:        I think it was personal. They wanted to retaliate against me. I think for a good portion of it, Rockwell PD behaves for the most part. They’re not near as bad as Dallas or Fort Worth or Baltimore or some of the bigger cities, but they still have bad cops in their department. \n",

      " Content: In this video installment of Battleground Baltimore, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez sits down with Laura Albans and Matt Papich, two workers at the renowned Baltimore Museum of Art who are involved in a crucial unionization effort that is currently taking place at the museum. From security guards and visitor services to art installers and curators, workers across departments are fighting to form a “wall-to-wall” union with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 67. After officially announcing their unionization effort in late September, BMA workers have joined a broader surge in labor organizing at cultural institutions around the country, including at the nearby Walters Museum in Baltimore. According to the union’s mission statement, “We, the BMA staff, are part of the wave of change that is happening at cultural institutions around the country. By forming a union, we will champion better working conditions for all employees and create a positive cultural shift throughout the institution and the Baltimore community.” In this interview, Alvarez talks with Albans and Papich about the work they do, how the unionization drive developed, and where things currently stand between workers and museum leadership. Laura Albans is a curatorial research associate who has worked at the BMA for nearly two decades; Matt Papich works in the exhibitions design and installation department and has been with the museum for 15 years. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Cameron Granadino Maximillian Alvarez:    This is Maximillian Alvarez, editor-in-chief at The Real News Network, reporting from The Real News studio here in Baltimore. If you frequent The Real News website, then you know that our ongoing series Battleground Baltimore is devoted to lifting up the lives and struggles and investigating the stories that matter to everyday people here in the city that we call home. As part of that ongoing mission, I recently got to sit down with Laura Albans and Matt Papich, two workers at the renowned Baltimore Museum of Art, who are involved in a crucial unionization effort that is taking place at the BMA as we speak. Workers across departments are fighting to form a wall-to-wall union with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Just from talking to Matt, Laura, and others at the museum, it’s abundantly clear that they deeply love their work and their coworkers. But they believe that organizing in a union will give workers power to improve their working conditions and their pay, to help the museum attract and retain talented staff, and to ensure that workers have a seat at the table when important decisions are being made. Matt Papich:          I’m Matt Papich. I’m an exhibition coordinator at the Baltimore Museum of Art. I’m also on the organizing committee for the BMA union, and I’ve worked at the BMA for nearly 15 years through a few departments. Laura Albans:       I’m Laura Albans. I’m an assistant curator for European painting and sculpture. I have been with the BMA for 19 years. And I came in in a very odd way, where I was hired to work for two departments as a full-time employee, but each department I was to work part-time. That was conservation in European, well, painting and sculpture at that time. And they were, at the time in 2002, the two busiest departments. And I was part-time for each. Maximillian Alvarez:     Well, Matt, Laura, thank you both so much for sitting down and chatting with me today. I really appreciate it. I know that you guys got a lot going on right now with the unionization effort at the Baltimore Museum of Art, which is right down the road from us. And that’s really what we’re here to talk about today for The Real News Network as part of our ongoing series Battleground Baltimore, where we want to get to know more about the people, lives, struggles, and stories happening here in our hometown. \n",

      " Content: In the wake of the recent Nicaraguan elections, the US imperialist war machine is once again directing its wrath at the governments of Nicaragua and Cuba. In response, anti-imperialist leftists around the world are rightly denouncing the onslaught of US aggression, sanctions, and propaganda, but many are also pushing for the left to engage in serious debate about how revolutionary governments can maintain systems of democratic accountability and hold true to the principles from which they were born. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc talks with Circles Robinson, who has been living between Nicaragua and Cuba since late 1984, about the Nicaraguan elections and the need for such debate to take place, both within Nicaragua and the broader left sphere. Before moving to Cuba, where he now works as editor of Havana Times, Robinson worked in Nicaragua for the National Union of Farmers and Ranchers and edited the Nicaragua Farmer’s View. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:     Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. Today, we continue our Real News conversations about Nicaragua that Max Alvarez began in his conversation last week with William Robinson. Today, I bring you a conversation with Circles Robinson, who has no relation to William. I met Circles in 2015 while taping stories in Havana, Cuba. And Circles, as we called him then, is an American citizen who’s been living between Nicaragua and Cuba since late 1984. He worked in Nicaragua for the National Union of Farmers and Ranchers, and then he was editor of the Nicaragua Farmer’s View. He moved to Cuba where he worked for Prensa Latina and Estee from 2002 to 2009. Then from 2008 until now, he’s an editor of the Havana Times, the position he held when we first met in Cuba. We talked together from Bisbee, Arizona. I’m really glad you could join us today, Circles. I’m looking forward to this conversation. I hope you’re well. Circles Robinson:    Me too. I’m glad to be with you on your show. Marc Steiner:      Let’s talk a bit about this election, let’s start there. Let’s start with the election that just took place in Nicaragua and the numbers of presidential candidates who were not candidates because they were in prison.

      " Content: For years, prisoners, activists, and legal advocates have been drawing attention to the inhumane conditions at Rikers Island, New York’s most infamous jail complex. But the COVID-19 pandemic turned what was already a dire situation at Rikers into a full-blown humanitarian crisis. With cells grossly overcrowded, guards and medical staff largely absent, and an interior crumbling from disrepair, Rikers became a hotbed of contagion and needless death. What’s worse, as Judge Jonathan Lippman recently wrote in The New York Times, “90 percent of the human beings subjected to the appalling conditions at Rikers are there pretrial, many because they cannot afford bail. Almost 1,600 have been waiting for a trial for over a year. Almost 700 have been waiting for more than two. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with Olayemi Olurin about the ongoing crisis at Rikers and the renewed wave of outrage from the public and elected officials who are demanding that the jail be closed for good. Olurin is a public defender and staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society and an analyst at the Law & Crime Network. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling The Bars. Recently, the governor of New York had declared a state of emergency around the Rikers Island jail. Joining me today to talk about what’s happening with Rikers Island, the jail, the boat that’s accompanying it, is a staff attorney, public defender from the Legal Aid Society, Olay Olurin. Olay, thank you for joining me. Olayemi Olurin:     Thank you all for having me. I feel honored and humbled and whatnot. Eddie Conway:    Okay. Can you just start off first by telling us what the situation is with Rikers Island today? Olayemi Olurin:      All right. So listen, Rikers is infamously a terrible place. We’ve had the Close Rikers campaign for several years now, so it’s not unknown that what’s happening in Rikers is always at the level of a human rights crisis. But now it’s especially so, forcing them to have to declare the state of emergency because there have been 14 deaths this year already in Rikers. So what happened was last year we had historic bail reform in New York City in January 2020, and at the height of the pandemic they rolled it back, just out of the blue. We had got an 11%, I think Rikers was at a historic lows when bill reform set in. And they went in during a COVID package in the dead of night and they rolled it back, and then we’ve had a pretrial detention spike. So now what’s happened is Rikers is overcrowded, that’s where it really started. So what happened with the COVID pandemic is that it’s overcrowded, they have like 50 people in a cell. They started piling the cells, putting people who have COVID already in gen pop. Nobody could get medical attention. Then if you combine that with the fact that the staff themselves, they have a union, they have unlimited sick days. They stop coming in. So they stopped coming in altogether during the pandemic, and the crisis just spiraled. And despite pleas from public defenders to release people, stop incarcerating people, they haven’t, and the deaths just continued to go up. \n",

      " Content: Ten years ago, the landscape for workers’ rights and organized labor in the state of Wisconsin changed dramatically with the passage of Act 10 under Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Act 10 was a hammer blow to the labor movement that essentially stripped collective bargaining rights from public sector workers, made it much more difficult for workers to organize, and forced unions to take massive concessions on healthcare, retirement benefits, and much more. Soon after, in 2015, Walker signed legislation that turned Wisconsin into a “right to work” state, issuing another blow to unions in a state once heralded as a bellwether of the labor movement. But all hope is not lost. In the wake of this coordinated assault on workers and unions, many are using the tools available to them to build up their communities and rebuild working-class power in Wisconsin. As part of a special collaboration with In These Times magazine for “The Wisconsin Idea,” TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez traveled to Wisconsin with Cameron Granadino (TRNN) and Hannah Faris (In These Times) to speak with teachers and organizers around the state about how Act 10 impacted their lives and work, and how they are rebuilding out of the rubble. In the first installment of this series of special reports, Alvarez speaks with Maricela Aguilar Monroy, an undocumented educator and organizer who has spent most of her life in Milwaukee, and who is working to strengthen the community that has provided a home for her so it can continue to provide a home for others. The Wisconsin Idea is an independent reporting project of People’s Action Institute, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, and In These Times.

Earlier this summer, I got to travel to Wisconsin as part of our special collaboration with In These Times to investigate the changing political terrain in the Badger State. Along with reporting on rural Wisconsinites’ fight against the factory farming industry, we spoke extensively with teachers and organizers around the state about the trajectory of the labor movement in Wisconsin. Especially after the coordinated assault on workers and unions that turned Wisconsin into a right-to-work state and that stripped public sector workers of their collective bargaining rights with the passage of Act 10 under Republican governor Scott Walker 10 years ago. In the decade since Act 10 passed, the landscape for workers rights and organized labor has changed dramatically. But all hope is not lost. In this special series of reports, we’ll be speaking with folks on the ground who are using the tools that they have to strengthen their communities and rebuild working class power in Wisconsin. And we’re going to be kicking off this series with a conversation that I got to have with Maricela Aguilar Monroy. An undocumented educator and organizer who has spent of her life in Milwaukee, and who is working to strengthen the community that has provided a home for her so that it could continue to provide a home for others. Maricela Aguilar Monroy:    Hello everyone, my name’s Maricela Aguilar Monroy. I am a teacher from Milwaukee Public Schools here in Milwaukee. I teach high school. I’m a long time, not a long time member, I was going to say a long time member. I’ve been living in Milwaukee for a very long time. I moved here when I was three. I have grown up here all of my life, and I am part of an undocumented mixed status family. \n",

      " Content: As a canonized work of fantasy fiction, a Hollywood institution, and a global cultural phenomenon, JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings is in a class all its own. Not only has the series had tremendous cultural staying power since its original publication in the 1950s, renewed for generations with Peter Jackson’s film adaptations, but it became a lifeline for many people quarantining throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Why have Tolkien’s works captivated us for so long? What does it tell us about our world and about the world Tolkien created that each perpetually has so many revealing things to say about the other? How has the series become the subject of an unending interpretive battle between reactionaries and revolutionaries who want to claim it as their own? And what does it mean to truly love The Lord of the Rings for what it is, warts and all? In the inaugural episode of her new TRNN podcast Art for the End Times, writer and editor Lyta Gold dives deep into one of the most complex, lore-filled, and culturally enduring works in the fantasy canon with journalist, researcher, and diehard Lord of the Rings fan Talia Lavin. Lavin is the author of the critically acclaimed book Culture Warlords: My Journey Into the Dark Web of White Supremacy, and her writing has been featured in outlets like The New Yorker, The New Republic, The New York Times Review of Books, the Washington Post, the Village Voice, and more. She also writes regularly on her Substack The Sword and the Sandwich. Subscribe to the TRNN podcast on your favorite podcast player so you don’t miss an episode of Art for the End Times! Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Lyta Gold:     Hi, everyone. This is Lyta Gold coming at you live from The Real News Network. Wait, wait. We’re not live? Oh, you’re going to edit the shit out of this. Okay, that is great. Can I swear on this thing? All right. I’m just going to roll. I am deeply honored to join the team here at The Real News Network. It hosts a number of spectacular shows that are dedicated to interviews with working people, to the lives of prisoners and to prison abolition, to wide-ranging looks at political and cultural movements throughout the world. But what I’m bringing you is something a little bit different. This is going to be a dedicated arts and culture podcast. Arts and culture analysis often occupies a funny place on the left. Everybody fucking loves talking about books and movies, but everybody also feels the need to justify talking about books and movies. You will run across these questions like, is cultural analysis something the left should be spending its time on? Is cultural analysis maybe the only thing the left should be spending its time on, given the effects of mass media on our psyches and politics being downstream from culture, et cetera, et cetera? Or, arguably, is this podcast or anything else worth doing at all, given climate change and a hundred other disasters that are coming down the pipe? But that’s why this podcast has this title, Art for the End Times. We’re going to address how we talk and how we think about art and culture, especially at this time when it feels like maybe the world is ending. But since we’re not the only people in history who have felt like maybe the world was ending, we’ll also look at works that have been popular in the past and are maybe still popular now, and try to tease out these deeper thematic and personal and political meanings that we find. We’re not just going to look at popular art. We’re also going to look at neglected works, underappreciated works, and kind of in general at how art gets made. Spoiler, most of the time that process is super ugly and gross. I do want to clarify a couple of things this podcast is not going to be about. I’m not really interested in looking at a piece of art and deciding if it has the good politics and is therefore good, or the bad politics and is therefore bad and stupid and nobody should talk about it. We’re always going to be looking at everything here from a leftist and from a political point of view, but if a work is entirely reducible to some kind of political allegory, then usually one of three things is happening: One, the work isn’t very good; two, the criticism isn’t very good; or three, the work actually is a rare example of a genuine allegory, but it’s not that common to find those these days. That’s just to make sure that we’re all clear on our terms and our approach. Another thing besides allegory that you’re not going to find too much of on this show is contempt. I don’t have a lot of time or a lot of patience for a supposedly left analysis of popular culture that regards people who consume popular culture, which is literally all of us – I don’t like it when people like that are regarded as stupid sheep with bad taste. It’s mean, but I’m not really upset about it being mean. I just don’t think it’s really a left analysis. There’s this idea that media consumption ought to be difficult or unpleasant. It’s like eating your vegetables, and pop stuff is like junk food, et cetera. There’s some validity here but really, you have to think about how this has roots in this really classist bourgeois mentality where art is something you consume and something you digest. You get it in your body and it makes you a more serious and respectable and upstanding citizen. There’s actually a really long history of this, and I really want to get into it on a future episode, but not this one. In general, though, I want to get past this classist framework around art and what you’re supposed to like and what you do like. I’m really interested in what people actually like, what works for them. If we want people to engage with more obscure and less popular works, how do we let them know that they even exist? Poptimism aside, there is often a snob factor, and it turns people off of good art they might otherwise like. But even beyond that, there are ways in which the structures of power make it really hard and really frustrating to even make or to find good art in the first place, so I want to talk about all of that. When it comes to this podcast, I’m coming at this through a couple of different lenses. I’m a fiction writer and I’ve also written a fair amount of cultural criticism. I’m a trained librarian also, which is part of why I’m really interested in these questions of curation and access. How do people find good art in the first place? I’ve held a lot of different jobs. I’ve worked in retail. I worked in a chocolate shop. Okay, you know that I Love Lucy episode where she’s eating chocolate off the assembly line? That was me. I did not last very long at the chocolate shop. After that, I worked for a couple of exploitative non-profits. I once worked for an exploitative small magazine, and that’s all we’re ever going to say about that on the show. And a couple of years I actually worked in the corporate offices of Marvel Entertainment, so I’ve been inside the belly of the pop culture machine. I’ve seen how the sausage gets made, and it’s gross. It’s very gross. But people do love a lot of that sausage, and I do think love is worth talking about and thinking about and addressing. Even if you don’t take the work seriously, how people relate to things is almost more interesting than what is actually happening. But speaking of love, I want to turn to something that I really love, which is something that a lot of people really love, and something that they still love even here at the end of all things. That’s right, it’s a Lord of the Rings episode, everybody. All right, so here we’ve got some books that were written in the ’30s and the ’40s. They weren’t published until the 1950s. J.R.R. Tolkien actually sent his son, Christopher, some of the chapters of Return of the King while Christopher was on the front lines in Germany during World War II. It was a pretty dark time as they go. The books, interestingly enough, while they’re very dark in places, they’re not grim and they’re not hopeless. I think the movie adaptations, one of the reasons that they’ve really lasted, is that they capture that mix of tonalities really, really well. This is very interesting that they remained so popular, because it’s not always true of blockbusters, especially adaptations. Some of them really do not last. But Lord of the Rings has stuck around since it was written and since these movies came out. The movies were essential pandemic viewing for a lot of people. There’s this great headline in Esquire, One Simply Does Not Get through Quarantine Without Watching The Lord of the Rings. So the story holds up. It holds up and it remains hugely influential on the whole genre of modern fantasy. That’s even though, and maybe it’s kind of because, it’s also really reactionary and bigoted. Don’t worry, we are absolutely going to talk about that part of it. We’re not going to whitewash it. We’re not going to ignore it because a lot of people like me love this stuff, but a lot of right wing and libertarian people love this stuff, too. I brought in an expert today to talk about this, an expert on both the right wing and on Lord of the Rings. This person is Talia Lavin. Talia Lavin:    Hello. Hi. Lyta Gold:    Hi. I am – \n",

      " Content: This week, PAR continues its coverage of the overt abuses of police power by examining new data that shows just how dangerous—and even deadly—systematic over-policing can be. PAR hosts Taya Graham and Stephen Janis break down several cases that show how police use pretextual car stops to expand their power, challenge the constitutional rights of citizens, and expand the reach of the country’s law-enforcement-industrial complex. Post Production: Adam Coley Taya Graham: Hello, my name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to achieve that goal by examining one of the biggest drivers of bad policing that simply does not get the attention it deserves: governmental greed, and how the need for cash is turning cops into variable bounty hunters. But, before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. You know I read your comments and appreciate them. And of course you can always reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And of course, if you can please hit the Patreon donate link pinned in the comments below, we do have some extras for our PAR family. Now, if there is one theme on this show that emerges time and time again, it’s just how much police love to make unnecessary traffic stops and profit from them. Through literally dozens of stories we have accounted how cops have pulled people over under dubious pretext and proceed to give them a ticket, or even arrest them without a real justification. Don’t believe me? Well, consider just a few of our recent shows. There was Arizona driver Perry Taylor, who was pulled over for the mercurial crime of aggressive driving and was subsequently dragged from his car and charged with a crime. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Speaker 1:   Get out of the car. Perry Taylor:    I’m asking you to give me a ticket. I’m asking you. Speaker 1: You’re not getting a ticket. Perry Taylor:     You’re trying to go for your arrest quota and I’m not going to allow it to happen. Speaker 1:       Get out of the car. Speaker 2:      No, don’t. \n",

      " Content: On Nov. 7, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega secured a fourth consecutive term in the country’s latest round of national elections with Rosario Murillo, Ortega’s wife, serving as Vice President. Prior to his current run as President, which began in 2007, Ortega had headed the government throughout the 1980s, first through the Junta of National Reconstruction after the Sandinista National Liberation Front ousted the right-wing Somoza dictatorship in 1979, and then as President from 1985 to 1990. Nicaragua’s electoral authority has said that voter turnout in this week’s elections reached 65% and that Ortega’s Sandinista alliance secured about 75% of votes cast. The United States is currently leading an international chorus rejecting the legitimacy of the elections and condemning the Ortega-Murillo government, with President Joe Biden threatening action against Nicaragua. “What Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, orchestrated today was a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic,” Biden’s official statement says. The “United States, in close coordination with other members of the international community, will use all diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support the people of Nicaragua and hold accountable the Ortega-Murillo government and those that facilitate its abuses.” The aggressive posture and threats of sanctions (or worse) from President Biden follow a well-worn path of flexed imperialist might, political and even military intervention, and self-serving definitions of democracy that the US has often deployed against left-wing governments throughout Latin America. In response, leftists of different stripes in North America and beyond have denounced President Biden’s threat while also claiming that accusations of rigged elections in Nicaragua or doubts about the leftist bonafides of Ortega’s government are entirely unfounded. But there is a lot more context that needs to be unpacked here, and doing so from a historically honest and anti-imperialist perspective is vital to understanding the very real political crisis in Nicaragua. In this interview, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with professor and Latin American specialist William I. Robinson about the deeper historical context surrounding Nicaragua’s elections, the very real political crisis that many are not seeing, and the need for the internationalist left to oppose US imperialism while soberly assessing the abuses of the Ortega-Murillo government. William I. Robinson is Distinguished Professor of Sociology, Global, and Latin American Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara. He worked in Managua with the Nicaragua News Agency and the Nicaragua Foreign Ministry in the 1980s and was affiliated faculty with the Central American University in Managua until 2001. Along with authoring a series of analyses of the 2021 Nicaraguan elections for the North American Congress on Latin America, Robinson has authored, co-authored, and edited numerous books, including Global Capitalism and the Crisis of Humanity; David and Goliath: The U.S. War Against Nicaragua; The Global Police State; and A Faustian Bargain: U.S. Intervention in the Nicaraguan Elections and American Foreign Policy in the post-Cold War Era. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Maximillian Alvarez: Welcome everyone to The Real News Network. My name is Maximillian Alvarez, I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News. It’s so great to have you all with us. On Nov. 7, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega secured a fourth consecutive term in the country’s latest round of national elections. Prior to his current run as president, which began in 2007, Ortega headed the government throughout the 1980s. First, through the Junta National Reconstruction, after the Sandinista National Liberation front ousted the right wing Somoza dictatorship in 1979, and then as president from 1985 to 1990. We are recording this in the immediate wake of the elections, but as of right now Nicaragua’s electoral authority has said that voter turnout reached 65% and that Ortega’s Sandinista alliance has secured around 75% of votes that have been counted. But questions about the legitimacy of the election have come from expected places, including the United States. On the night of the elections, President Joe Biden released a statement, saying, “What Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife Vice President Rosario Murillo orchestrated today was a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic. The arbitrary imprisonment of nearly 40 opposition figures since May, including seven potential presidential candidates, and the blocking of political parties from participation rigged the outcome well before election day. They shuttered independent media, locked up journalists and members of the private sector, and bullied civil society organizations into closing their doors. Long unpopular and now without a democratic mandate, the Ortega and Murillo family now rule Nicaragua as autocrats, no different from the Somoza family that Ortega and the Sandinistas fought four decades ago.” \n",

      " Content: In retrospect, “Ida” seems too tame a name for the lethal storm that made landfall on Aug. 29 in Port Fourchon, Louisiana—on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. With wind speeds just short of 157 mph, Ida took 95 souls in the US, tracked across nine states. 11 New Yorkers drowned while trapped in flooded basement apartments. A nightmarish encounter landed one 71-year-old Louisiana man inside the gut of a 12-foot, 500-pound alligator. Following an almost parabolic path of destruction, Hurricane Ida couldn’t have made the point any more sharply that the wild beast of climate change is not lurking in some near or distant future—it’s here. A scientific fact, long predicted, repeatedly warned against, persistently and deliberately lied about by the fossil fuel industry, now mercilessly unleashed anew with each passing season.  With the ever-quickening pace of the digital news cycle, stories about Ida and its destructive force hit hard, hit quickly, and then dissipated much like the hurricane itself. But for those who felt its wrath firsthand, the damage lingered long after most media left, and the struggle to rebuild is, for many, very much ongoing.   As storm-impacted communities continue to right their upended realities and reestablish their lifelines, The Real News Network spoke with representatives from three organizations on the ground in Mississippi and Louisiana who, in Ida’s wake, brought immediate disaster relief to people in New Orleans, the river parishes, and down the bayou: Kali Akuno, executive director of Cooperation Jackson; Kendra Unique Wills, an organizer with Southern Solidarity; Loan Fund steering committee member Maya Pen, who is also an organizer and artist; and founding member and project loan officer Susan Sakash of Cooperation New Orleans. Each of these organizations has a mission-based commitment to participating in the solidarity economy, and all of them categorize their disaster relief efforts as mutual aid work.  These organizations and these people share the view that mutual aid is a transformative economic practice that at once delivers needed support while dramatically shifting humans away from commodified relations toward productive (and ecologically sustainable) ones. \n",

      " Content: With few exceptions, traditional accounts of the development of the modern world put European history at the center of everything, often focusing on the “Age of Discovery” and global expansion, the Enlightenment, and so on. “The history of Africa, by contrast, has long been relegated to the remote outskirts of our global story,” as Howard W. French asserts in his critically acclaimed and game-changing new book. “What if, instead, we put Africa and Africans at the very center of our thinking about the origins of modernity?” In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc talks with French about his new book, Born in Blackness: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to the Second World War, and about the forcibly forgotten history of Africa’s central place in the making of the modern world. Howard W. French is a professor of journalism at Columbia University and former New York Times bureau chief in the Caribbean and Central America, West and Central Africa, Tokyo, and Shanghai. He is the author of numerous books, including A Continent for the Taking: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa and China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner: Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. Today we take another exploration into history, a history that has been lost to us, but one that has a profound effect on today’s world. When it comes to defining civilization, Africa’s centrality to it is often ignored, its importance purposely belittled and diminished. Few realize that central African kingdoms made alliances with European kingdoms, that Europe never ruled Africa until the late 19th century, that the Haitian revolution forced France out of the new world allowing US dominance. And there’s a straight line between these events as there is from African enslavement, to wealth accumulation, to the rise of capitalism. And unraveling this historical tale is what we’re going to do this hour, in our conversation with Howard W. French. He’s a Professor of Journalism at the Columbia School of Journalism, a renowned, award-winning journalist who’s lived and taught West Africa, reported overseas for the Times, was a Bureau Chief in Central America, the Caribbean, West and Central Africa, Japan, the Koreas, China. Twice, he’s won the Overseas Press Club Award, and he’s the author of numerous books. And today we talk about his latest work, Born in Blackness: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to the Second World War. It’s eye opening, interesting, and he joins us today. Howard, welcome. It’s good to have you with us. I appreciate you being able to take the time for this conversation. Howard French:  It’s a pleasure to be here, Marc. Marc Steiner: So, let’s just begin. This is really… What’s fascinating to me when this book first came across [a transom] and I saw what it was about, I really wanted to dive into it for numerous reasons, especially the thesis that started you off, and let’s talk about that. How West African kingdoms and West Africa in general began to define the modern era in ways that we have not allowed to be part of our history. And B, that Portugal, not Spain or anybody else, set this whole engine of modernity, for want of a better term, into motion of history. So, talk about how that… What that thesis is generally and how you came to it. Howard French:  Sure. So, there are a few different things to unpack here and I’ll try to take them in stages. Marc Steiner:  Sure. \n",

      " Content: 35,000 members of the Alliance of Health Care Unions, a coalition of 21 local unions representing over 52,000 workers at the healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente in states around the country, have set a strike date. Unless the company addresses the serious issues that workers have raised at the bargaining table, Kaiser workers will walk off the job on Nov. 15, and thousands more may join in what could become one of the largest strikes ever in the healthcare sector. The core issues that led to the potential strike not only involve adequate compensation for union workers, but also the dire concerns about healthcare workers being grossly overworked and under-resourced, as well as two-tier employment and the struggle to draw in and retain trained staff. On top of the essential concerns that directly impact the jobs and livelihoods of healthcare workers, the outcome of this high-stakes labor struggle will have huge implications for the future of healthcare in the US as we know it. In this special edition of Working People, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with two Kaiser workers, Hannah Winchester, DPT, and Nicholas Eng, RNFA, about the work that they do, the changes they’ve experienced in the healthcare system, and the dire conditions that have led to a potential strike. Hannah Winchester is a home health physical therapist by trade; she is also her department’s Labor Partner, a shop steward, and a member of the bargaining team for the Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals (OFNHP) Professional Bargaining Unit. Nicholas Eng has been a nurse for nearly 10 years; he is also an OFNHP shop steward and is currently on release for OFNHP to be present for contract bargaining and to help with organizing union members and actions, including strike planning. Additional links/info below… Working People, The Real News Network, “A Small-Town Hospital Goes After Its Union Nurses” Post-Production: Adam Coley Maximillian Alvarez:        Well, welcome, everyone, to another special episode of Working People, a podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network, and supported entirely by listeners and viewers like you. So, Striketober has come and gone, and many of the struggles that folks were excited about over the past month are still very much ongoing. Ten thousand workers at farming equipment giant John Deere are currently still on strike as of this recording, as well as 1,400 cereal workers at Kellogg’s plants in Nebraska, Michigan, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. Coal miners at Warrior Met Coal in Alabama have been on strike since April. Eight hundred nurses at Saint Vincent Hospital in Massachusetts have been on strike since March. As we record this, New York taxi drivers are in their second week of a hunger strike. And of course as we all know what many are calling the great resignation, that is historic levels of American workers voluntarily quitting their jobs in 2021, is still a phenomenon that is ongoing as well. The point being that something is happening amongst the American workforce right now. Many are excited about it. Many are feeling very sympathetic towards this increasing labor strife as workers coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic are feeling more emboldened to demand the pay and the treatment and the respect that they always deserve. Among those workers who are currently in the process of authorizing what could be one of the largest strikes in the United States are healthcare workers at the healthcare giant, Kaiser Permanente. As Noah Lanard at Mother Jones reports, “For current employees, Kaiser is proposing a 1% annual raise for the next three years, which amounts to a pay cut after accounting for inflation. The Alliance of Healthcare Unions, the coalition of 21 locals now considering whether to strike, has been pushing for 4% raises, no two-tier wage system, and contract language that ensures safe staffing levels. The deal being negotiated between Kaiser and union leaders will cover more than 50,000 workers in states spanning from Georgia to Hawaii. It could lead to one of the largest healthcare strikes in recent US history. Workers’ biggest problem with the wage proposal that Kaiser has presented is that it would cut starting pay for new hires by between 26% and 39% beginning in 2023. They believe it would deepen an existing staffing crisis at Kaiser’s facilities and put patients at risk by making the nonprofit unable to recruit and retain talented workers. There are also fears that it would lead to resentment among those paid less for the same work, or cause Kaiser to replace the more expensive workers covered by the old contract with new hires.” So, folks listening to the show, or if you are watching the video version at The Real News Network, will be familiar with workers’ demands to undo this two-tier wage system that folks have been hearing about. It’s been an issue at the John Deere strike. It is the primary issue at the Kellogg strike. It was an issue at the Heaven Hill Distillery strike in Kentucky. And it has been a long running issue in the auto manufacturing industry, as well as industries around the country, and healthcare is no different. \n",

      " Content: Mansoor Adayfi, “Detainee No. 441,” was imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay for over 14 years without charges as an enemy combatant. As detailed in the description for Adafyi’s new book Don’t Forget Us Here: Lost and Found at Guantánamo, “Arriving as a stubborn teenager, Mansoor survived the camp’s infamous interrogation program and became a feared and hardened resistance fighter leading prison riots and hunger strikes protesting inhumane treatment and arbitrary detention. With time though, he grew into the man nicknamed ‘Smiley Troublemaker’: a student, writer, advocate, and historian.” In this special episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer, legendary Black Panther, and longtime political prisoner Eddie Conway sits down with Adafyi to talk about his new book, his time at Guantánamo, the human cost of the War on Terror, and about the battle for survival in the dark heart of American empire. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. One of the things that everybody in the world knows is that Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, is a horrible place to be. Today, we have the opportunity to talk to Mansoor Adayfi, who’s an author, an activist, and a former detainee at Gitmo, joins us today. Mansoor, thanks for joining me. Mansoor Adayfi:    Thank you so much for having me today, and for giving me this opportunity to talk to you guys and talk to the world. Thank you. Eddie Conway:     Okay. You know, I want to start off… I guess I want to start off by apologizing for my tax money that’s been used for horrible things. Mansoor Adayfi:      No. I won’t accept that. Don’t apologize for others’ hideous behavior. Because you have done nothing, and I won’t accept any apologies from you because if someone cuts me, I’m not going to spill my blood on anyone. So, I mean, we don’t blame America or Americans for what happened to us, to be honest with you. And we don’t hold anyone accountable for what has been done to us. Sorry for the interruption, because I always – [crosstalk]. Eddie Conway:     No, it’s okay. Mansoor Adayfi:       I understand you feel sometimes frustrated and guilty and… But from my understanding, it’s not what America is about. It is, we are considered those small groups who didn’t represent, or don’t represent America or American values. Simple as that. Eddie Conway:         Okay. All right. So then will you give the audience a little background history, how you end up in 2002 in Guantanamo. Where did it start from and what happened? Mansoor Adayfi:       Okay. Before we jump to Guantanamo, I would like to highlight just two points. The first point, I noticed that a lot of people talking about 9/11, which I’m not trying to undermine and [inaudible], but at the same time, people forget to talk about what happened before 9/11 and what led to 9/11 to happen in the first place. As we know [about] the United States’ involvement in Afghanistan since the 1980s and 1990s. And also that 9/11 happened the first time in 1993, as we recall, in my research that we found out when the same person targeted the same twin towers. But then the thing that happened, the 9/11 when the war started between one organization, one man, Osama bin Laden and the United States, and that led to 9/11. And we know that a few attacks happened before that. 9/11 didn’t change the world; The way Americans or the American government at that time reacted to 9/11, it changed the world. 9/11 was misused and abused until that day. And as we know, it has been like almost 20 years and there was [inaudible] justice. And delaying justice is justice denied, simple as that. So basically let us jump to after 9/11. Before 9/11, I was in Afghanistan. I was sent as a research assistant in Afghanistan to research the new group in Afghanistan, because as you know, in the 1990s there was a vacuum in the media. And Al-Qaeda emerged really fast because it was fighting one of the super powers. And that time they said, a man against a superpower country, to the extent. And they start building up. 9/11 happened while I was in Afghanistan, and when it did happen, we didn’t pay much attention to it or care much about it. \n",

Rick Bass says he does not consider himself a “typical tree hugger.” The  63-year-old Texas transplant is an avid hunter and started his professional life as an oil and gas geologist. But Bass fell in love with the Rocky Mountains in college, and in 1987, he moved to a “blank spot on the map”—the remote wilderness of the Yaak Valley in Northwestern Montana. Bass, never quite at home anywhere else, found himself surrounded by a rugged landscape of rocky peaks and coniferous forests, including the Kootenai National Forest. To hear him tell it, there is nowhere quite like the Yaak Valley. On Biden’s watch, the US Forest Service is quietly moving forward with a series of Donald Trump–era plans to open up commercial logging in the Kootenai, despite the fact that the impacts of these projects were never subjected to rigorous analysis. It wouldn’t take long for Bass to realize that the area was under constant threat from road construction and commercial logging, because of the untapped timber in the area. In 1997, Bass and three other social activists cofounded the Yaak Valley Forest Council (YVFC) to protect the natural habitat of the “sensitive, threatened, and endangered species” around him, including grizzly bears and lynxes. \n",

      " Content: As we have been covering at The Real News, coal miners in Brookwood, Alabama, represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), have been on an unfair labor practices strike against Warrior Met Coal since the beginning of April. Now entering their eight month on strike, workers and their families are facing violence on the picket line, vilification from the company, and even court orders that infringe on their legally protected right to picket. And yet, striking miners and their families continue to hold the line and provide support for one another—and they say they will continue to do so for as long as it takes. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc speaks with Braxton and Haeden Wright about the conditions that led to the strike at Warrior Met Coal, what families have endured throughout the strike, and how solidarity from supporters around the world has kept them going. Braxton Wright is one of the UMWA miners on strike in Alabama; he comes from a family of miners and has been working at the mine now owned by Warrior Met Coal for 17 years. Haeden Wright is president of the UMWA Auxiliary Locals #2368 and #2245; she is a high school teacher who also comes from a coal mining family. Braxton and Haeden are married. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner. It’s good to have you all with us. As many of you know, Real News has been covering the miners striking in Alabama, in Brookwood, Alabama, for some time now. And it’s been seven months since these mine workers have been on strike. The company is owned by a place called Warrior Met, and they own these mines, and forced them in 2016 to take a $1.4 billion in concessions. That’s $1.4 billion. And forcing workers to work six days a week, work 12 hour shifts without adequate compensation in mines that are dangerous enough because they’re so deep. So as I said, we’ve been covering this strike, we’ve been on the scene, we’ll continue until it’s done, and now we’re joined by two people who are in the midst of all that. Braxton Wright is one of the UMWA miners on strike at Warrior Met Coal. He’s from a family of coal miners that’s been working in that mine for 17 years. And Haeden Wright is with us, she is president of the UMWA Auxiliary Locals #2368/#2245. She’s a high school teacher, also comes from a coal mining family. And you guessed it, yes, they’re married. So welcome. It’s good to have you with us both. Braxton Wright:     Thank you. It’s good to be here. Haeden Wright:       Thank you for having us on. \n",

      " Content: Another act of defiance from the last residents of Poppleton, West Baltimore’s historic, Black neighborhood, who are fighting to preserve their homes. On Nov. 1, a local artist, who asked to remain anonymous, and activists with Organize Poppleton helped residents paint a 20-foot mural that reads “SAVE OUR BLOCK. Black Neighborhoods Matter. Losing my home is like a death to me. Eminent Domain law is violent.” The quote is from Sonia Eaddy, a third-generation Poppleton resident whose family has lived in the same house since the 1940s. Eaddy has waged a years-long campaign to preserve this Poppleton community, which dates back to the 1860s. The words are painted on the side of Eaddy’s 321 North Carrollton Ave. property, which the city claimed from the longtime resident and community leader by exercising its rights under eminent domain. The rights to develop the neighborhood were acquired by New York-based La Cité Development, which has already built luxury apartments in the neighborhood that start at $1,925 a month for two bedrooms. Having received $58 million in tax breaks from the city, the developer is required to make 20% of 2,800 overall housing units affordable to low-income residents. Back in July, Battleground Baltimore spoke to longtime Poppleton resident Parsha Macfadden, who has lived in her home for four decades. “It seems like it’s not fair for the homeowners who have invested so much, whose homes have so much history and meaning for their families,” Macfadden told Battleground Baltimore.  \n",

      " Content: Did prosecutors silence a progressive activist under the guise of enforcing an obscure law? That’s the issue PAR explores as we look at the case of a pot legalization activist who was charged with two felonies for livestreaming an encounter with a conservative congressman’s aide during a protest. Taya Graham:        Hello, my name is Taya Graham. As the host of the Police Accountability Report, I always promise that this show has a single purpose: holding police accountable. And sometimes keeping that promise requires a follow-up to a story that we’ve reported on before. I mean, think about it, you can’t hold the politically powerful institution of law enforcement accountable if they don’t think you have the tenacity to keep reporting on their misdeeds. So, this brings me to the story from the past that we’re going to highlight today. It’s a tale that starts with the prosecution of a young college activist. His name is Jake Burdett. His crime: Streaming the comment of a congressman’s aide during a protest on Facebook. Now, before we replay our interview with him and explain the circumstances of why he was charged with, wait for it, felony wiretapping, I also want to give you a little background on some important breaking news that makes this story even more vital. The ordeal for Jake started when he attended a protest outside of the office of conservative Congressman Andy Harris. He was there because Harris was trying to block the efforts of DC residents to legalize marijuana, which the residents had voted to enact. The protestors met with one of the congressman’s aides in his office. And even though the public officials office asked the activist not to record the encounter, Jake did, and the felony wiretapping charge came as a result of Maryland being a two-party consent state for recording any communication. What happened due to that decision is an example of the scary power and the constant overreach of prosecutors. And just for the record, when Jake was asked to take the Facebook recording down, he did within minutes of being asked. But the other reason we are covering the story again is because of some new developments regarding the office that prosecuted Burdett. Just recently, Maryland’s highest court ordered a special hearing to determine if the same prosecutors who charged Burdett, engaged in misconduct in a different case. And for more on this, I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephjen, thank you for joining me Stephen Janis:    Taya, thanks for having me, I appreciate it. Taya Graham:        So, Stephen, can you tell me about the recent decision and what the court ruled? \n",

Both cases involve the constitutionality of the controversial Texas abortion law, SB 8. While the hearing left it unclear how the Court would eventually rule on SB 8, the comments of many justices were an ominous harbinger of what’s to come. Said comments certainly suggest that when the court takes up the Mississippi case Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization in December, the continuing Constitutionality of Roe v. Wade will clearly be at risk of being overturned—or at least dramatically altered.  SB 8, which was passed and signed into law by Governor Greg Abbot on May 18 and took effect in Texas on Sept. 1, was the first of its kind (although Ohio legislators have proposed a similar bill this week). And it has had an unorthodox trip through the court system. As Mary Ziegler of SCOTUSblog notes, “The litigation surrounding SB 8, the Texas law that bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, has been many things, but never ordinary.” \n",

Since then, the battle in British Columbia has only gotten more intense as Indigenous land protectors and non-Indigenous activists put their bodies on the line to defend the ancient rainforest in the Fairy Creek and Central Walbran areas, facing arrest and forced removal by Canadian police. In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc speaks with Morin about what she’s seen on the ground covering this crucial struggle to preserve unceded First Nations land from the onslaught of settler-colonial violence and the environmentally destructive logging industry. Brandi Morin is an award-winning French/Cree/Iroquois journalist from Treaty 6 territory in Alberta, Canada. Her work has appeared in numerous outlets, including Al Jazeera English, The Guardian, The National Observer, The New York Times, Vice Canada, and CBC Indigenous. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. Now, I know that most of us have not heard of Fairy Creek, or the Pacheedaht First Nation, or a company called Teal-Jones, or the fact that since August 2020, Indigenous people and their political allies have been trying to stop that company from cutting down the last of the old-growth forest in British Columbia that fuels a multi-billion dollar industry. It’s a struggle where thousands have been arrested, and police violence against protesters, beating protesters, and literally pulling people out of trees by helicopters, has been heavy and intense. And in the midst of all of this, the British Columbia government, run by a left wing party called the New Democratic Party, seems to be allowing this to happen. Now, I was made aware of this because of a dear friend’s daughter who’s been in the midst of this struggle. So I’ve been in touch with Indigenous leaders and their allies, mostly white activists, and we’ll be hearing from them in the coming weeks. But today we hear what’s happening on the ground from a journalist, Brandi Morin. She’s a French/Cree/Iroquois journalist from Treaty 6 in Alberta, Canada, and she’s been covering injustice, human rights, environment, culture, tradition, and resilience from an Indigenous point of view. She writes for Al Jazeera and many other publications, and joins us here today on the Marc Steiner Show at The Real News. So, Brandi, welcome to the program. It’s good to have you with us. I’m glad you could find time to join us. Brandi Morin:    Hay-hay [Plains Cree for “thank you”]. Thank you for having me, Marc. Marc Steiner:        So you just got back home from Fairy Creek, is that right? \n",

Bernie Sanders, lawmakers in vulnerable districts, and grassroots progressive groups are ramping up their last-ditch effort to rescue a plan to lower US prescription drug prices as the longstanding—and widely popular—Democratic campaign promise is at risk of being excluded from President Joe Biden’s signature domestic policy bill. As top Democratic lawmakers continued discussing a possible compromise on medicine pricing over the weekend, Sanders (I-Vt.)—the chair of the Senate Budget Committee—made clear Sunday that he still sees prescription drug reforms as a crucial component of the Build Back Better Act, which has been sliced in half to appease corporate-backed Democrats in the Senate and House. \n",

      " Content: Calls to “defund the police” reverberated throughout communities across the US in the summer of 2020, when millions took to the streets to protest a brutal, unchecked, and racist system of police violence and control. Then came the backlash. Since the initial push by activists and protestors to get the public to consider alternatives to endlessly increasing police spending, a forceful chorus has pushed in the opposite direction, demanding more funding for more police who should be given more power over our lives. “Defund the police” has been criticized for being not only a “bad slogan” but a political pipe dream that fails to reckon with the messy realities of maintaining “public safety.” However, as Geo Maher argues in his latest book, A World without Police: How Strong Communities Make Cops Obsolete, America’s policing system is a demonstrably terrible way to keep people and communities safe. In fact, Maher writes, police “don’t prevent violence, and they don’t make any measurable contribution to public safety… The police have wormed their way into the very foundations of American society and work every day to make themselves—and their bloated budgets—seem indispensable.” In this special conversation for the TRNN podcast, Police Accountability Report Host Stephen Janis speaks with Maher about his groundbreaking assessment of American policing and the practical necessity of collectively devising better models for communal safety. Pre-Production/Studio: Stephen JanisPost Production: Stephen Janis, Stephen Frank Stephen Janis:    Hello, this is Stephen Janis. I’m the host of the Police Accountability Report. Now, usually when you listen to our podcast, we’re talking about some specific police action or some sort of malfeasance on behalf of law enforcement. But today we’re going to do something a little bit different. We want to broaden the conversation about police and include some critical context and history. And to do that, we’re going to be speaking to some people who’ve written books about policing; critical books, historical books, to give a different perspective on how policing can be reformed. And even in this case, how policing can be abolished. And today we’re going to do that by talking to an author named Geo Maher, who has written a book, A World Without Police. It’s a fascinating look at policing, not just the flaws of policing and some of the misconceptions and the mythology that surrounds policing, but actually looking at what a world would be like without police. I mean, let’s remember, policing is a recent invention of governance. It didn’t really exist till the mid-19th century. So it’s not something that has always been part of human communities. And Geo really takes an interesting historical perspective and looks forward and says, what kind of community could we have without policing, and is there an alternative? And so today I’m going to discuss with him his book and some of the ideas he has about what a world is like without policing. And also just what we don’t understand about the critical conversation about policing, and how it’s been improperly framed and controlled and in some cases manipulated by what I would call the law enforcement-industrial complex. So Geo, I want to thank you so much for joining us. Geo Maher:        Thank you so much for having me. I’m glad to be here. \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Jacobin on Oct. 31, 2021. It is shared here with permission. Last month, the Fraser Institute put out its annual Economic Freedom of the World report. As usual, it showed that “economic freedom” is positively correlated with many good things and negatively correlated with many bad ones. Defenders of capitalism love the Fraser Institute. Libertarian philosopher Jason Brennan, for example, has made heavy use of the rankings in the context of criticizing the arguments of Marxist philosopher GA Cohen. Brennan argues that given all the positive things that come with greater economic freedom, the debate about whether capitalism is superior to socialism has a clear victor: the pro-capitalist side. The only remaining question is whether socialism would be better in a hypothetical world where humans were less selfish and lazy. Economist Peter Leeson has deployed the Fraser Institute’s reports to mount an even more strident defense of capitalism. Many commentators, Leeson writes, think that capitalism deserves “two cheers” for yielding many good outcomes while also thinking that “excessive” or “uncontrolled” capitalism can be bad. Leeson says this is wrong because the Fraser Institute’s numbers show that capitalism deserves three cheers. \n",

Did Rivera really jump off the roof of Baltimore’s Belvedere Hotel, or was he the victim of foul play? Why did the investigation into Rivera’s death come to such a sudden close? And why won’t police reopen the case as a potential homicide? Throughout this special investigation series, TRNN reporters Taya Graham and Stephen Janis have examined one of Baltimore’s most notorious and mysterious cases and detailed the glaring issues with the official police report that deemed Rivera’s death a suicide. In the third and final installment of this series, Graham and Janis discuss a new analysis of Rivera’s injuries by a medical illustrator, which points to an entirely different explanation of why and how a 32-year-old man with a lot to live for ended up dead in an abandoned hotel conference room.

      " Content: The arrest and incarceration of New Mexico resident Chris Dixon provide yet another stark example of the Kafkaesque nature of contemporary police power. Dixon was arrested after police tired to force him to consent to an illegal search of the business where he worked. But the actions of the officer, coupled with the fallout Dixon faced, show that American law enforcement deliberately wields its arbitrary and heavy-handed power to sow chaos and erode the rights of the people. Taya Graham:     Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to do so by highlighting how this encounter captured on video with a New Mexico cop led to the illegal jailing of one of our viewers. But it’s not just the seeming miscarriage of justice we’ll be covering, we’ll also take a close look at how officers often use arbitrary power to override the constitutional rights of citizens, and in doing so, erode the very foundations of democracy itself. But before we get started, I want you to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. You know I read your comments and appreciate them. And of course, you can always reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and you might notice there’s a patreon link to donate below. So if you want to, and if you can, there’s some extra there for the PAR family. Okay. Now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, on this show, we obviously highlight bad arrests and scenarios where cops simply make bad choice., But a video sent to us by a viewer in Artesia, New Mexico, highlights another factor of police overreach that warrants attention. It’s a video of an encounter between an Artesia, New Mexico, cop and a viewer named Chris Dixon. Dixon was working in a pawn shop when police arrived looking for the owner. The police had a warrant for the owner’s arrest, but not a search warrant of the premises. So they made an unusual request. They asked Chris to give them permission to search without a proper warrant. And this is where the example of an unusual type of police overreach occurs because Mr. Dixon was faced with a dicey dilemma: He himself was on parole, a fact that the cop seems to use to put Mr. Dixon in an even more precarious predicament, and get him to concede to an illegal search, or go to jail. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Speaker 1:         Chris, nobody wants anything from you today. We just want to get Kevin taken care of. Hey, relax, brother. You’re fine. Speaker 2:         So you don’t care if I go look just to make sure Kevin’s not in there. Chris Dixon:          Kevin is not in the pawn shop. Speaker 2:           So I can go look? Chris Dixon:       It’s not my place to give any kind of consent. Speaker 2:           You live there? Chris Dixon:          I don’t live in the pawn shop. I live in my house. My house is an apartment. Speaker 2:           That inside the pawn shop? Chris Dixon:       [inaudible] – Speaker 2:          So can I look in your apartment? Chris Dixon:         You can look in my apartment but there’s nobody – Speaker 1:           Hey Chris, right here. Right. Chris Dixon:        Where’s my wife at? Speaker 1:           She was walking over there. We’ll let you go over there in just a minute. We just want to make sure everything is safe first. Okay? Chris Dixon:       Can I leave with my wife please? \n",

      " Content: The International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism convened earlier this month in Malmö, Sweden. According to the Swedish government, “The programme focused on four main themes: Holocaust remembrance; Holocaust education; Antisemitism on social media platforms; and Combating antisemitism and other forms of racism in all spheres of life.” While the forum served as an important call to combat antisemitism in Europe and beyond, human rights advocates warn that the European Union is creeping dangerously close to criminalizing the speech of any who speak out against Israel’s settler-colonial and apartheid violence against Palestinians by conflating Judaism with Zionism and critiques of Zionism with antisemitism. In this interview, recorded from the Netherlands, TRNN contributor David Kattenburg speaks with Ronnie Barkan and Dr. Anne de Jong about the deeply troubling effort to stifle critiques of Israel and the chilling repercussions it could have in Europe and beyond. Anne de Jong is a member of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Amsterdam with a regional expertise on the Middle East (Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Bahrain); she was also an organizing member and participant in the 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla. Ronnie Barkan is an Israeli activist, a conscientious objector, and co-founder of Boycott From Within—a group of Israelis who support the Palestinian call for boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS). David Kattenburg:    Hello, and welcome to The Real News Network. My name is David Kattenburg reporting. Today, it’s my pleasure to have a couple of guests with us from the Netherlands. And Ronnie, are you right now in Israel? Ronnie Barkan:     Yes, I’m in Palestine at the moment. David Kattenburg:    In Palestine, right. We’re going to get to that distinction. A couple of interesting items in the news today, Interesting news often comes in pairs. On the 13th of October, a joint letter was published by both The Guardian and an open letter in NBC News, cosigned by or regarding a letter that has been sent to Google and Amazon signed by roughly 900 Amazon and Google workers calling on the two tech giants to cancel their involvement in something called Project Nimbus, which is a 1.2 billion venture that will provide cloud services to the Israeli government and military, and to the Israeli land authority, the agency that essentially steers Israel’s continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank in violation of international law. So nearly 1,000 anonymous signatories at Amazon and more than 600 at Google have joined this call, which is kind of astonishing. At the same time, this week there was a conference taking place in the city of Malmö in Sweden, the International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism, attended by Israeli lobbyists and EU officials. And one of the major items in the agenda is discussion of the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which critics say muzzles free political expression and expression of free points of view about the so-called conflict in Israel and Palestine. So, two interesting items of news. \n",

      " Content: The mysterious death of Rey Rivera has continued to stoke speculation and controversy, especially after the case received national attention from a Netlfix reboot of Unsolved Mysteries in July, 2020. In Part 1 of their three-part investigation, TRNN reporters Taya Graham and Stephen Janis reviewed the unsettling circumstances surrounding Rivera’s death and the ensuing police investigation. In Part 2, Graham and Janis take a closer look at the homicide case files, which were recently released by the Baltimore police and shed light on new clues and glaring questions about a case that remains unsolved to this day. This podcast was originally published on Nov. 21, 2020. Stephen Janis:    Anyone who watches crime dramas could reasonably conclude that when someone is murdered, barring bizarre and extenuating circumstances, the case is solved. That is, through high-tech forensics, moral resolve, or simply the near-mythic competence of American law enforcement, killers are ultimately sent to jail. But, as an investigative reporter who has worked in one of the most violent cities in the country for nearly 15 years, I can tell you this is not true. Taya Graham:        That is the point of this podcast, because unsolved killings represent more than just statistics. It’s a psychic toll of stories untold that infects an entire community. The final violent moments of a victim’s life that remain shrouded in mystery. Stephen Janis:    I’m Stephen Janis. Taya Graham:     I’m Taya Graham. Stephen Janis:      We are investigative reporters who live in Baltimore City. Taya Graham:     Welcome to The Land of the Unsolved. Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to The Land of the Unsolved. Today, we’re going to be taking another look at the mysterious death of Rey Rivera. As the world knows by now, Rey’s case was the subject of the hit reboot of the Unsolved Mysteries TV show on Netflix. The episode, titled Mystery on the Rooftop, recounted how Rey left his Baltimore home in May of [2006] and then mysteriously disappeared. Roughly nine days later, Rey’s partially decomposed body was found in the second-floor conference room of the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore. A hole in the roof above where his body was found seemed to indicate that Rey had jumped to his death. In fact, police said publicly that he had committed suicide. But Rey’s family was adamant that this was not the case, pointing to myriad of evidence showing that this suicide was all but impossible. Ray was recently married to the love of his life, Allison. He had just finished a screenplay. He had recently launched his own production company, and he was planning to move back to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of being a filmmaker. Today, the goal of our show will be twofold: First, I will talk to Stephen about new documents released by the Baltimore City Police Department regarding Ray’s death. Second, I will ask Stephen questions sent to him by people who watched the Unsolved Mysteries episode and are still curious about the case. Let’s start. Stephen, you received what one would call a document dump of files from the Baltimore Police Department. What was in there? \n",

The perennial dilemma for congressional progressives has always been that while they have a working moral conscience, their opponents don’t. This fundamental quandary is at work yet again, as progressives, after gamely holding the line for months on the Democrats’ infrastructure bills, are now coming under intense pressure to swallow another loss, smile, and say thank you. As Senator Joe Manchin, the public face of the corporate-funded wrecking ball that’s been taken to the party’s once-ambitious plans, reportedly told Bernie Sanders behind closed doors, he’s willing to go without any of the reconciliation bill’s measures passing, let alone the tatters that are left of it, if progressives continue to insist on their $3.5 trillion framework. \n",

Reflecting a troubling national trend that perpetuates the ongoing public health crisis under the guise of “freedom,” Baltimore City’s police union is speaking out against Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott’s vaccination mandate.  Organized opposition to vaccination mandates for Baltimore police emerged back in August when Baltimore City’s Fraternal Order of Police (FOP3) and the Baltimore City firefighters’ unions released a joint statement responding to Mayor Scott’s policy. “It is our desire to remain engaged in collective bargaining over the implementation of this policy,” the Aug. 31 statement said. “We look forward to working amicably with members of Mayor Scott’s administration to ensure this policy and its associated procedures are implemented fairly and equitably while protecting our member’s [sic] personal concern and autonomy.” \n",

      " Content: As the rich and comfortable stayed indoors and rode out the worst months of the pandemic on their Peloton bikes, workers around the country shifted into a different gear. Ten thousand farming equipment workers in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Colorado, and Georgia walked out of their jobs, joining 1,400 cereal workers at Kellogg’s plants in Nebraska, Michigan, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania, as well as 1,100 coal miners at Warrior Met Coal in Alabama and nurses in New York and Massachusetts. And thousands more are waiting in the wings—from workers in academia, to healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente in Oregon, California, and Hawaii, to film and television workers in the entertainment industry who averted a strike after threatening to walk off the job and reached a tentative agreement, which will now be voted on. In general, and on an individual level, workers are more confident than they’ve been in a long time, and they are seizing the crisis in front of them to their advantage. That’s not all. New York City taxi drivers have idled their iconic mustard-yellow cars and camped outside City Hall for more than a month, holding a 24/7 protest vigil that escalated to a hunger strike last week. The hunger strike by members and supporters of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance is taking place before a fast-approaching quarterly budget modification deadline on Oct. 31. Before the deadline, if he so chooses, Mayor Bill de Blasio can add a loan guarantee to lower the monthly payments on the crushing debts that drivers have accrued (averaging half a million dollars per driver) as a result of predatory licensing schemes.  \n",

      " Content: The mysterious death of Rey Rivera made national headlines when the case was investigated on the Netflix reboot of Unsolved Mysteries, which became the number one show on the popular streaming platform. Many viewers who have learned about the case are skeptical of the police theory that the young filmmaker jumped to his death from the roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore’s Mt. Vernon neighborhood. In Part 1 of this three-part podcast series, TRNN investigative reporters Taya Graham and Stephen Janis re-open the unsettling case that has captivated audiences and amateur detectives alike, exploring new evidence that points to a more sinister theory of how Rey Rivera died. This podcast was originally published on Oct. 13, 2020. Stephen Janis:    Anyone who watches crime dramas could reasonably conclude that when someone is murdered, barring bizarre and extenuating circumstances, the case is solved. That is, through high tech forensics, moral resolve, or simply the near mythic competence of American law enforcement, killers are ultimately sent to jail. But as an investigative reporter who has worked in one of the most violent cities in the country for nearly 15 years, I can tell you, this is not true. Taya Graham:     And that is the point of this podcast, because unsolved killings represent more than just statistics. It’s a psychic toll of stories untold that infects an entire community. The final violent moments of a victim’s life that remain shrouded in mystery. Stephen Janis:     I’m Stephen Janis. Taya Graham:        I’m Taya Graham. Stephen Janis:     And we are investigative reporters who live in Baltimore city. Taya Graham:     Welcome to The Land of the Unsolved. Welcome to The Land of the Unsolved, the podcast that explores both the evidence and the politics of unsolved murder in Baltimore. Today, we’re going to revisit a case that has received international attention. A mysterious death that still continues to reverberate throughout the city. Stephen Janis:    It’s the death of Rey Rivera, the 32-year-old filmmaker that disappeared from his North Baltimore home in May of 2006. Taya Graham:     By now, thanks to the Netflix show, Unsolved Mysteries, the entire world knows the story. Rivera left his home in a rush carrying only his keys and a credit card, never to be heard from again. Eight days later, his partially decomposed body was found in the conference room of the Belvedere hotel in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood. Stephen Janis:    A hole in the roof above where Rey lay led some to say he committed suicide. The theory was that he jumped to his death for reasons that remain unknown. But others, like his family, vehemently disagreed. Shortly after he was found I spoke to his wife, Allison, and his brother, Angel, and they were adamant. Rey had every reason to live. Taya Graham:        That’s because Rey was newly wed. He had just started his own film production company. He was planning to move back to California, where he had met his wife, and he just finished a screenplay. Hardly the life story of a man who was going to kill himself. Stephen Janis:     But again, there was a hole in the roof. The mysterious sequence of events that led to his disappearance, hints of danger before he died, including twice when an alarm went off in his home. Taya Graham:        But much of that evidence didn’t make sense. Rey didn’t tell anyone where he was heading the day he disappeared. Found on the roof near the hole where he died, one flip flop and a cell phone, not broken, but in full working order. And even more troubling, no witnesses who had seen him at the hotel. Surveillance video of the upper floors of the hotel inexplicably erased. His car was found in a lot nearby, but there was little indication of how it was parked there. All of it intriguing, but not conclusive. \n",

      " Content: The vast network of ready-to-launch intercontinental ballistic missiles that make up the United States’s nuclear triad remains a constant source of apocalyptic risk that few in politics or the media will openly acknowledge. Even if the Cold War threat of imminent nuclear war has dissipated from the public mind, the threat of catastrophic accidents and even humanity’s mutually assured nuclear destruction has by no means disappeared. Instead of confronting this threat head on, the government is funneling billions of dollars into ‘modernizing’ the nation’s nuclear arsenal. As Daniel Ellsberg and Norman Solomon write in a recent piece for The Nation, “The history of nuclear weapons in this country tells us that people will spare no expense if they believe that spending the money will really make them and their loved ones safer—we must show them that ICBMs actually do the opposite.” In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc speaks with Ellsberg and Solomon about the persistent threat of nuclear disaster and why it needs to be at the center of our political concern. Daniel Ellsberg is a former American military analyst employed by the RAND Corporation who precipitated a national uproar in 1971 when he released the Pentagon Papers, the US military’s account of activities during the Vietnam War, to The New York Times. Ellsberg has continued as a political activist, giving lecture tours and speaking out about current events. Norman Solomon is the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, the author of War Made Easy, and a cofounder of RootsAction.org. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have y’all with us once again. Though it gripped the world for many, many years, most of us don’t think about nuclear weapons or the possibility of a nuclear war, a war that could literally wipe us all out. And we don’t think about it especially now given COVID and the deep political divide that exists in the United States and across the world, environmental disasters looming, or just living our lives. But Dan Ellsberg and Norman Solomon brought it into glaring relief with their recent article in The Nation that was entitled To Avoid Armageddon, Don’t Modernize Missiles – Eliminate Them. In the article, they take on the reality that our government wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to upgrade our land-based ICBM missiles, despite the fact that military leaders and former defense officials say it’s a boondoggle foisted on the American people by Northrop Grumman, who would make billions of dollars on this deal, and what we once called the military-industrial complex. And that all of this could really trigger an Armageddon. It’s an interesting moment when former military officials and anti-war activists agree on stopping land-based missiles together. And all this seems to be happening under the radar of our awareness. Today, we’re joined by the two men who wrote that article. One is the legendary Dan Ellsberg who, when he was a military analyst during the Vietnam War, and at great risk to himself, secretly released the Pentagon papers to The New York Times that proved to the American people that they’d been lied to and deceived to both start and continue the Vietnam War. And over the decades, he’s continued to be a political activist, giving lecture tours and talking around the world. And Norman Solomon, who’s been a leading voice in the fight for democracy and world peace. He’s the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, author of the book War Made Easy, and co-founder of rootsaction.org, a website you should definitely check out. And welcome to the program. First of all, I want to thank both of you for agreeing to do this today. I’m looking forward to this. Norman Solomon:    Sure. Daniel Ellsberg:    So am I. So am I. Marc Steiner:      And actually, when I read the article, and for all of us listening out there, the article is called To Avoid Armageddon, Don’t Modernize Missiles – Eliminate Them, that appeared in a recent issue of The Nation magazine. And I immediately wrote to Norman and Dan. And here they are. So, let’s just begin. \n",

John Yarmuth. However, she faces a primary that may highlight the divide between the Democratic Party’s activist base and conservative donors more than any in the nation.  “For a long time we’ve convinced ourselves that we were ‘liberal’ without really talking about what that meant.” Scott, who made national headlines last year when she and her daughter were unjustly arrested during the Breonna Taylor uprisings in Louisville (the charges were later dropped and Scott is now suing the Louisville Metro Police Department), thinks that her background of challenging Democratic leadership would make her a natural fit for the Squad. “I can only hope that they would welcome me into the Squad,” Scott told TRNN. “I know myself politically that, here in Louisville and Kentucky, I tend to be someone who challenges and questions the Democratic Party to do better, to stop leaving behind young people, women, and people of color, and the Squad does that in DC—they challenge the party to be better and to do right by people, and that’s exactly what I want to do.” \n",

In this episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, founder of The Ordinary People Society, about the shocking move by the state of Alabama to divert desperately needed relief funds to build up its carceral system. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling The Bars.

At this very moment, 10,000 UAW members at John Deere are on strike in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas; 35,000 healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente have authorized a strike; 1,400 workers at cereal giant Kellogg’s are on strike in Nebraska, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee; 1,100 coal miners in Alabama have been on strike since April; 800 nurses in Massachusetts have been on strike since March; and numerous other strikes and strike authorizations are also unfolding. On top of that, record numbers of US workers are voluntarily quitting their jobs, in what is being called the “Great Resignation.” At the same time, there are crucial struggles happening that may not seem as dramatic as collective strikes but are no less important for the future of the labor movement. One of these struggles is taking place within the United Auto Workers itself, where members are currently voting on an unprecedented referendum that will decide whether or not the 400,000 working members and nearly 600,000 retirees can directly elect their top union officers. Ballots went out on Oct. 19 and are due back at the end of November. If the referendum passes, it could be the beginning of a massive shakeup for the union, which many members say needs more democratic governance and more militant energy coming from the rank-and-file. Unite All Workers for Democracy (UAWD), a grassroots caucus of UAW members advocating for direct elections, has been leading the charge for this historic referendum. In this episode of Working People, we talk with Justin Mayhugh, who has worked at General Motors in Kansas City for over a decade and is an organizer with the UAWD caucus.

So, some of you all already know this, but our amazing producer, Jules, and his family, have been going through a really rough time, and we want to show them all the love and support we possibly can. I don’t want to put too much of their business out in public, but if you want to know more, you can click on the link in the show notes to the GoFundMe that’s been set up to assist Jules and his family during this difficult time. Now, if you have it in your hearts and your wallets, please donate what you can to their GoFundMe and we’re going to make it our goal to hit that fundraising goal with this livestream that we’re going to be doing on Sunday and that I’ll be hosting. And trust me, it’s going to be a lot of fun, right? I mean the listener live hang session was awesome. This is kind of going to be a livestream version of that. We’re going to hang out, we’re going to talk about Strike-tober. We’ll have some spooky Halloween fun. We’ll have some special friends and guests drop by and of course, we’ll be responding live to your questions and your comments in the live chat. So yeah, again, please help us support Jules and his family, share the fundraiser in the show notes, donate what you can and mark your calendars so you don’t miss our live stream this Sunday, Oct 24, starting at 7:00 PM Eastern Time for our man Jules and his family. We love them, and we need to support them. So yeah, come hang out with us, help us raise the money that they need and thank you guys so much for doing that. All right. So we’ve got a nice big, meaty episode and an amazing conversation to share with you all, so let’s get to it. Now, as we all know, there is a lot of important history being made right now in this moment, and something potentially game changing is unfolding among the American workforce. And as we speak, 10,000 UAW members at John Deere are on strike in Iowa, Illinois. In Kansas, 35,000 healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente have authorized a strike, and I believe that that number may be closer to 50,000 by the time that you hear this. It’s kind of like IATSE right? There are a number of different locals that are all kind of have sort of different timelines. But anyway, that’s a shit ton of healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente, and that’s a really important struggle. On top of that, 1,400 workers at the cereal giant Kellogg’s are on strike in Nebraska, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. \n",

      " Content: The ancient city of Hebron, said to be the burial site of the prophet Abraham, is the second holiest site in the Jewish world, the fourth holiest site in the Muslim world, and currently the largest Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank. Besieged by the violence of Israeli occupation and economic turmoil, Hebron has become a pressure cooker of settler aggression and Palestinian resistance—and the human toll has been immense. In this important segment of The Marc Steiner Show, we get an on-the-ground view of the daily reality of Israeli occupation and apartheid from Basil al-Adraa and Oriel Eisner, who say that the violence in Hebron has gotten demonstrably worse over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Basil al-Adraa is an activist, journalist, and photographer from the village of a-Tuwani in the South Hebron Hills; Oriel Eisner, who currently lives in Jerusalem, is an American-Israeli activist and organizer with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner: Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. Today, we’re going to explore what’s happening in one of the most ancient cities on the planet, Hebron. It’s the home of the Cave of the Patriarchs and the Matriarchs, said to be the burial ground of the prophet Abraham and his wife, Sarah, and their sons and wives. It’s considered the second holiest city in the Jewish world, and the fourth in the Muslim world. And, Hebron is the largest Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank. A gritty working class city of 215,000 Palestinians. And now, about 1000 right-wing religious Israeli settlers were moved in, and have taken over the center of the city and the surrounding hills. It’s a town where the Palestinians have lost control and gangs are prevalent, in large part because of the chaos of the occupation that allows Palestinians to only control 20% of their city. It’s become the scene of massive settler violence, who are seizing land, homes, destroying olive groves, injuring children, arresting children. Palestinians in Hebron and Israelis who stand with them have been resisting these attacks, and themselves been attacked, injured, and arrested. Two of the men who are at the center of all of this join us today for a conversation. Basil al-Adraa is a Palestinian activist, journalist, and photographer from the village of At Tuwani, which is in Hebron. And Oriel Eisner is an American Israeli activist, and organizer with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence. He’s based in Jerusalem. And this is our conversation. Let’s get some history here, and maybe get a sense of where Hebron is, why it’s so important, what it’s meant to this struggle, and what’s been happening. So who should begin that? Oriel, why don’t you start? And then Basil, you jump in? Can we start it that way? Let’s do that. \n",

There, Biden fielded questions from realtors, college professors, college students, and other members (or future members) of the professional–managerial class, and mostly told them that much of what Americans want is going to take “several years.” Free community college likely wasn’t going to happen soon but would happen later on, he assured the Loyola University professor who asked about it. Biden explained to a Morgan State University faculty member that he was busy with other concerns but would soon get around to maintaining voting rights and police reform. In Baltimore, a majority Black city whose median income was, as of 2019, $29,943, the pomp and circumstance of the town hall and the lack of urgency from the president were especially stark. “We need police officers to protect us,” Biden said. “I call for more money for police to go to community policing.” \n",

      " Content: A questionable traffic stop by an Arizona highway patrol officer reveals how the powers bestowed upon police are ripe for abuse. Video shows how the officer escalated the encounter after he was challenged by a motorist to justify his actions. In this episode of the Police Accountability Report, we break down how the misuse of police power during a single car stop reflects a broader anti-democratic imperative that drives American policing. Taya Graham:        Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: Holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to achieve that goal by reporting on this disturbing video of a brutal arrest by Arizona Highway cops. It’s an encounter sent to us by a viewer, who was dragged out of his car by police for a crime that has yet to be determined. But, it’s also an example of how far cops will go to enforce their arbitrary sense of power, and how quickly they will sacrifice both the safety and well-being of the public to maintain it. But, before we get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. You know I read your comments and appreciate them. And of course, you can always reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And if you can, take a look at the Patreon donate link pinned below in the comments, because we do have some extras for the PAR family. All right, now we’ve gotten all that out of the way. Now, as we’ve reported on before, policing in America is quite often focused on objectives that appear to have little to do with public safety. It’s an idea that seems to be ingrained in the culture of policing, which emphasizes enforcing power over the people, rather than maintaining public safety. And no police encounter could be more illustrative of this point than the video I’m going to show you now. It’s a video, sent to us by viewer Perry Taylor, who was pulled over by the Arizona Department of Safety Highway Patrol Division in the summer of 2021. The officer said he had been driving erratically and following too closely to another vehicle before changing lanes. However, the interaction between the cop and our viewer quickly escalates, as the officer makes a seemingly odd request that would put both of them in danger. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Patrol Officer:    Hello, I’m [inaudible] patrol. The reason I’m stopping you today is for your driving behavior. Perry Taylor:        My driving behavior? Patrol Officer:    Yeah. Perry Taylor:         I just let off the brake. Can you explain? Ashley:        Yeah, can you explain? Patrol Officer:    You’re weaving in – What’s that? Ashley:        Can you explain? Perry Taylor:      [crosstalk] I’m weaving in and out? How am I not allowed to weave in and out? Like, I’m just changing lanes.

The infiltration of app-based rideshare services like Uber and Lyft has been disastrous for taxi workers and their industry, undercutting rates and creating a perpetual race to the bottom for everyone. On top of that, taxi drivers in New York City, many of whom are immigrants and people of color, have found themselves crushed under the weight of massive debt and are facing financial ruin. This debt stems from the artificially inflated cost of taxi medallions, the city-issued permits drivers are required to have to own a cab and pick up street hails in the city. In this urgent interview, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with Mouhamadou Aliyu and Bhairavi Desai about the dire situation taxi drivers are facing and their life-or-death struggle to get City Hall to take action.

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Truthout on Oct. 19, 2021. It is shared here with permission. On Oct. 20, at least half a million workers in South Korea—from across the construction, transportation, service, and other sectors—walked off their jobs in a one-day general strike. The strike will be followed by mass demonstrations in urban centers and rural farmlands, culminating in a national all-people’s mobilization in January 2022. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), the country’s largest labor union umbrella with 1.1 million members, is organizing these mobilizations in a broad-based front with South Korea’s urban poor and farmers. The 15 detailed demands of the strike can be summarized as fitting within three basic areas: Today, South Korea ranks third in highest annual working hours and as of 2015 it was third in workplace deaths among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Over 40% of all workers are considered “irregular workers.” As in the US, many of these irregular workers labor in the gig economy, beholden to tech giants’ apps. South Korean workers have thrown down the gauntlet, and we should all pay close attention. \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Labor Notes on Oct. 20, 2021. It is shared here with permission. Ten thousand John Deere workers in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas launched an open-ended strike Oct. 14. The strike came after workers overwhelmingly voted down a first tentative agreement negotiated by the Auto Workers (UAW). Among the over 90% of members voting, 90% voted no. Members’ frustrations ranged from inadequate wage increases to an end to the pension for new hires, switching to a “Choice Plus” plan that many felt was scant on details. And they feel emboldened by a tight labor market and pandemic-related parts shortages that have made it hard for Deere to build up inventory. At Deere’s Tractor Cab & Assembly Operations in Waterloo, Iowa, the 8000 tractor line—which workers refer to as the “money-maker”—was already over 800 units behind schedule at the start of the strike, according to Dana Thibadeau, a third-shift steward. That line produces tractors that can cost up to $800,000. “When you factor in the pandemic, being deemed essential workers, and in our case, having a company turning a record profit, the CEO giving himself a 160% raise, and giving a 17% dividend raise, we kinda feel like we’re left to kick rocks,” said a UAW member at Iowa’s Davenport Works who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation. Deere is in the midst of its most profitable year ever. The farm and construction equipment manufacturer expects to rake in $5.7 to $5.9 billion in net income this year, far exceeding its previous high of $3.5 billion in 2013. \n",

Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show, here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. I think we’re in the midst of a seemingly historical moment. Worker militancy is seething across the country. We’ve had well over 169 strikes this year, from the John Deere workers striking, to IATSE, which is the Hollywood union, taking on the Hollywood bosses. The hospital workers at Kaiser Permanente and nurses across America are standing up, to name just a few. The surge was sparked by the militancy of teachers across America early this year, and as far back as 2011. So, as we watch the surge of the right wing, we’re also seeing a surge in union organizing and strikes that not only pushes against the power of capital and capitalists themselves, but threatens the right wing. Where might it go? What could it mean for the future of this nation and the future of labor? Well, today we talk with Alex Han. He spent 20 years as a labor organizer, as a former union leader, and currently, he’s the Bargaining for the Common Good fellow at the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and Working Poor at Georgetown University. Well, Alex, it’s great to have you with us. Welcome, glad you could join us. Alex Han:        All right. Thanks for having me, Marc. Marc Steiner:        Besides the introduction, this is a way of quick background for people listening to us right now. You’ve been involved in the union movement for a long time, and with different unions. Talk a bit about yourself for just a second. Alex Han:         Yeah. I’ve spent most of the last 20 years as an organizer, a staffer, and officer of the union. The bulk of it is with SEIU Healthcare, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas. My former local union, which I served as a vice president for many years, but have organized in a lot of different industries all across the country, and continue to do work with unions and groups of workers that are organizing and fighting. Right now, through my role with Bargaining for the Common Good Network, really working with unions and community organizations to figure out strategies to, just like the name says, to bargain for the common good. To talk about both campaigns that can, I think, take the leverage that unions have, particularly in contract negotiations, and win demands that are much broader than just for their membership. \n",

On Saturday night, Deadline reported that a tentative agreement had been reached between the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which represents “below the line” workers in the film and television industry such as cinematographers, grips, hair stylists, costumers, and editors, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which includes Warner Bros., Netflix, Amazon, Disney, and many other studios. The three-year contract, known as the Basic Agreement, covers the union’s 13 Hollywood locals. Negotiations have been ongoing for months, and the announcement came just before the Sunday night deadline set by the union, at which point 60,000 IATSE members across the country would have begun a strike, shutting down film and television production nationwide. That strike, which was authorized by a vote of 99% in favor, with 90% of eligible members casting ballots, would have been the largest such private-sector action since the 73,000-person United Auto Workers (UAW) strike at General Motors. Ratification is not a done deal. After news of the tentative agreement broke on Saturday night, IATSE members began dissenting, loudly. \n",

      " Content: In the state of Louisiana, 786 inmates—none of whom were ever sentenced to death—died behind bars between 2015-2019 while serving out their prison sentences. Since Black people are already incarcerated at disproportionate rates, these deaths have been disproportionately among Black inmates. This information has not been publicly available until now, because no single authority in Louisiana is required to collect such data. When law professor Andrea Armstrong and her students took it upon themselves to conduct this research, they were shocked by what they found. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with Armstrong about investigating the quiet horror happening inside Louisiana prisons and what can be done to stop it. Professor Armstrong joined the Loyola University New Orleans,College of Law faculty in 2010 and founded IncarcerationTransparency.org, a database that provides facility-level deaths behind bars data and analysis for Louisiana and memorializes the lives lost. She is a leading national expert on prison and jail conditions and is certified by the US Department of Justice as a Prison Rape Elimination Act auditor. Pre-production/Studio/Post-production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling The Bars. It’s recently been reported in newspaper articles that Louisiana state has the highest death rate of incarcerated prisoners in the United States. The reason that was discovered was because professor Andrea Armstrong from Loyola University in Louisiana has put together the data and the research on that. So, joining me today to talk about what she discovered and why she discovered it, is professor Andrea Armstrong. Thanks for joining me, professor. Andrea Armstrong:    Thank you so much for the invitation. I’m excited to share the work that I’ve been doing with my students for the last two years. Eddie Conway:    Can you just start off by giving our audience an overview of this research that you’ve done and, in general, what you discovered? Andrea Armstrong:     Yeah. So, a couple of years ago… I’ve been working in the space around incarceration for almost a decade now, and I was following deaths that were happening at specific jails in Louisiana. And I went looking for a list, a list of people who had died behind bars, so I could understand whether these jails were outliers. Were they different? And, there wasn’t a list. No one had a list. And so, what I started doing with my students is we filed public records requests on 132 different facilities in the state of Louisiana. That’s eight state-managed prisons, several private facilities, federal detention facilities, as well as local jails. And, we collected death records for the periods 2015 to 2019, so a five-year period. What we found is 786 people died behind bars during that five year period, and not one of them had been sentenced to death. Eddie Conway:     I also see that your data showed that there was a disparity between the amount of people of color in the state of Louisiana and the amount of deaths occurring in the jails and the prisons. Can you talk about that for a minute? \n",

      " Content: The world was a very different place when Robin DG Kelley’s renowned book Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination was first published in 2002. As the reality of post-9/11 America and the war on terror hardened into a dystopian, jingoistic consensus, and as the global economy careened towards impending catastrophe, the possibility of a future in which peace, justice, and equality reigned had all but disappeared. And yet, as people in the darkest of times throughout human history have done, many still had the audacity to dream of—and fight for—something better. Now, 20 years later, as we face the reality that unchecked capitalist pillage, endless war, and climate catastrophe have put humanity on a path to mutually assured destruction, the future seems bleaker than ever, and the possibility of averting disaster feels more unattainable than ever. How do we confront the enormity of all this devastation and still keep fighting? How can we keep hope alive that we can save ourselves, humanity, and the planet when the world around us gives us so little cause for hope? As we continue the impossible struggle for a better world, how do we deal with constant failure without succumbing to defeat? In this special interview, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez and Kelley grapple with these questions and discuss the continued necessity of freedom dreaming—and fighting like hell—in the face of catastrophe. Robin DG Kelley is currently the Distinguished Professor and Gary B. Nash Endowed Chair in US History in the Department of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research has explored the history of social movements in the US, the African diaspora, and Africa; Black intellectuals; music and visual culture; surrealism, and Marxism, among other vital topics. His essays have been published in general publications and academic journals across the board, including the Journal of American History, American Historical Review, The Nation, Monthly Review, New York Times, Color Lines, Social Text ,The Black Scholar, Journal of Palestine Studies, and Boston Review. He has authored and edited numerous influential books, including Africa Speaks, America Answers: Modern Jazz in Revolutionary Times; Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original; Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination; Race Rebels: Culture, Politics, and the Black Working Class; and Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists During the Great Depression. Maximillian Alvarez:        Welcome, everyone, to The Real News Network. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News, and it’s great to have you all with us. As you all know, here at The Real News we do our best week in, week out to not only report on the people, issues, and struggles that are so often forgotten by corporate media, and we also try to bring you the human voices and deeper context that get lost behind the headlines. From workers organizing in their workplaces, to the victims of the prison-industrial complex, to grassroots efforts by everyday people around the world who are fighting for a better world. But we also try to compliment that coverage with deeper conversations that help us unpack and interrogate the larger complex forces that have shaped our world into what it is, and that also help us do the hard work of imagining something better and getting there together. We’re going to be bringing y’all more of these deeper conversations moving forward here at The Real News, and I, frankly, could not be more honored to be joined by our guest today to help us kick off that effort. I’m joined today by none other than professor Robin D.G. Kelley, a thinker, scholar, and activist whose work and heart and impact on the world truly need no introduction, but I’m going to do it anyway. So, professor Kelley is currently the distinguished professor and Gary B. Nash Endowed Chair in US History in the Department of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research has explored the history of social movements in the US, the African diaspora and Africa, Black intellectuals, music and visual culture, surrealism, Marxism, among other vital topics. You’d be hard pressed to find publications that have not featured professor Kelley’s work, but his essays have been published in general publications in academic journals across the board, including the Journal of American History, American Historical Review, The Nation, Monthly Review, The New York Times, Color Lines, Social Text, The Black Scholar, The Journal of Palestine Studies, and Boston Review. His authored and edited books are as incredible and invaluable as they are numerous. I won’t embarrass him by reading all of them, but some of the titles include Africa Speaks America Answers: Modern Jazz and Revolutionary Times; Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original; Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination; Race Rebels: Culture, Politics, and the Black Working Class; and Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists During the Great Depression. Professor Kelley, Robin, thank you so much for joining me today. Robin Kelley:            Thank you so much. I’m such a big fan, so I’m kind of nervous. \n",

      " Content: Earlier this week, the new Vice President for Public Safety of Johns Hopkins University and Hopkins Medicine Branville Bard Jr. discussed the university’s planned armed private police force in an internal email sent to “the Johns Hopkins Community” and obtained by Battleground Baltimore. The email is light on specifics and heavy on, well, saying the right thing, and that’s what makes it interesting. “I was excited about the opportunity to take on this role at Johns Hopkins because of the institution’s comprehensive vision for public safety, one that reflects the truth I have long understood: There is far more to public safety than police or security officers; they are just one element of our broader public safety strategy,” Bard wrote. Bard joined Hopkins in July. From 2017-2021 he was the police commissioner of the Cambridge Police Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and before that, he spent 21 years with the Philadelphia Police Department. In the email, Bard promised to begin speaking to Baltimoreans, Hopkins students and faculty, and “affinity groups” about the private police force.  A look at Bard’s work in Cambridge suggests a similar approach to Hopkins: deploying social justice language while defending and misrepresenting police powers in the name of reform. “Throughout my career, some of my most important relationships have been with those who are critical of the police. Indeed, I have found that often those who harbor the strongest objections to policing have the potential to be the most instructive in our growth and improvement,” Bard wrote. \n",

      " Content: As we previously reported at The Real News, voters in Berlin were recently faced with a game-changing referendum to expropriate housing held by giant corporate landlords who have made the city increasingly unaffordable for most residents. The passing of the referendum, and the organizing that made it possible, was not only a shock but a source of hope for many around the world who have seen options for affordable housing gobbled up by vampire capitalists and large companies contributing to the runaway financialization of the housing market. How were Berliners able to take on these big landlords and pass this historic referendum? What happens now? And can Berlin provide a model for those fighting for housing justice around the world?In this segment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc speaks with longtime TRNN contributor Molly Shah and Berlin-based activist Ian Clotworthy about the recent referendum and the great global housing struggle to come. Ian Clotworthy is from Ireland and has lived in Berlin for about 10 years; he is active in DW Enteignen (where he represents the Right2TheCity group), DSA Berlin, and the Green New Deal for Europe. Molly Shah is a freelance writer and social media consultant based in Berlin, and she’s a regular contributor to The Real News. Prior to moving to Germany, Molly was an activist, teacher, and lawyer in Louisville, Kentucky. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner: Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us once again. As many of us know, Germany has just had an election. On Sept. 26, most of the world was focused on Angela Merkel stepping down and the battle to replace her. Many people saw her as an icon of leadership. That’s a political discussion we will not get into today, but her party lost, and all that happened. But, one of the most important reverberations of all this that affects not only Germany and the EU, but people struggling for housing across the globe, took place in Berlin, in a referendum, where the majority of Berliners said that it would be okay to expropriate housing from landlords who own over 3000 dwelling units. \n",

      " Content: Facebook had a very bad week last week. First, Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook assigned to the Civic Integrity group, blew the whistle on her past employer, leaking a cache of internal company documents and testifying in front of Congress that the social media giant is knowingly and repeatedly “paying for its profits with our safety.” Then things got significantly worse when Facebook basically disappeared from the internet for 6 hours on Monday, Oct. 4. This was the biggest outage Facebook had experienced since a 2019 crash that took the site offline for over 24 hours. Facebook has said that last week’s outage was unrelated to news about the leaks and that it was the result of a routine software update gone horribly wrong. The outage, however, affected billions of people who depend on the suite of applications and services owned by Facebook that went offline, including Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. While Facebook is back online and the news cycle has largely moved on, it’s important to take a step back and examine what these outages tell us about the precariously assembled infrastructure of our digital world, our global dependence on that infrastructure, and the implications of having that infrastructure controlled by private, incredibly powerful, and voraciously profit-seeking entities like Facebook. In this interview for The Real News podcast, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with writer, commentator, and legal services attorney Sparky Abraham, who wrote a 2020 article for Current Affairs titled “A Series of Tubes: Reclaiming the Physical Internet.” Maximillian Alvarez:        Welcome, everyone, to The Real News Network podcast. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News, and it’s so great to have you all with us. So, let’s take a few minutes to talk about Facebook’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. So last week, things started off pretty bad for the social media giant when Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook who was assigned to the civic integrity group, publicly revealed her identity and blew the whistle on her past employer. As Alex Cranz and Russell Brandom at the Verge reported, “The whistleblower behind the leak of an enormous cache of Facebook documents to the Wall Street Journal, Frances Haugen, went public on 60 Minutes on Sunday, revealing more of the inner workings of the most powerful social media platform in the world. Revealing her identity on national television, Haugen described a company so committed to product optimization that it embraced algorithms that amplify hate speech. ‘It’s paying for its profits with our safety,’ Haugen told 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley. According to a since-deleted LinkedIn profile, Haugen was a product manager at Facebook assigned to the civic integrity group. She chose to leave the company in 2021 after the dissolving of the group. She said she didn’t ‘trust that they’re willing to invest what actually needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.’’” All right. So then Haugen testified in front of Congress about the content and the implications of the information that she leaked to the press and to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, in case you haven’t read it, here’s the opening to the blockbuster report based on Haugen’s leaks that has been published by the Wall Street Journal. It’s actually a series of reports, but this is the opening paragraphs on the main page of the Wall Street Journal. “Facebook, Inc. knows in acute detail that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions, and drafts of presentations to senior management. Time and again, the documents show Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges, and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company up to the chief executive himself.” So, that’s how Facebook’s week started. Then things got significantly worse when Facebook basically disappeared from the internet for six hours on Monday, Oct. 4. This was the biggest outage Facebook had experienced since a 2019 crash that took the site offline for over 24 hours. Facebook has said that last week’s outage was unrelated to news about the leaks, and that it was the result of a routine software update gone horribly wrong. Frankly, I don’t have the expertise to walk us through the specifics of that update and what went wrong and what it took to fix it, but we will be posting some explanatory sources in the show notes for listeners. \n",

      " Author: Maximillian Alvarez \n",
      " Date: 2021-10-14 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: Like Frito-Lay, Nabisco, John Deere, and Heaven Hill Distillery, cereal giant Kellogg’s has seen consumer demand skyrocket during the pandemic, reporting profits of $1.25 billion in 2020. To meet this demand, many workers in Kellogg’s plants around the US report pulling 12-16-hour shifts seven days a week, leaving little time for anything outside of work beyond sleep. But the creation of a two-tier employment system in 2015 has meant that newer employees in the lower “transitional tier” are earning significantly less than their coworkers for doing the same work. Demanding that the company raise the floor for all of its employees, Kellogg’s plant workers in Nebraska, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have been on strike since Oct. 5. In this special video edition of Working People, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez discusses the ongoing strike with Dan Osborn, who has worked at the Omaha, Nebraska, plant for 18 years and currently serves as president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), Local 50G. Maximillian Alvarez:        All right. Well, welcome everyone to another episode of Working People, a podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network, produced by Jules Taylor, and supported entirely by listeners like you. So, we’ve got a special and urgent Working People minicast for you all today. And we’re actually recording a video version of this as well, which will run over at The Real News Network YouTube channel. So if you want to check out the video version, definitely subscribe and go watch there. But as y’all may have heard, Kellogg’s workers at the cereal manufacturing giant, Kellogg’s, have gone on strike at plants in Battle Creek, Michigan, as well as Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Omaha, Nebraska; and Memphis. And workers with the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union hit the picket line last week. And we are here to get an update about what’s going on with this strike, to get an up-to-date report from one of these picket lines, and let you all know what’s going on and how you all can show support. And so I wanted to introduce you all to our guest today. Dan, why don’t you introduce yourself to the good folks? Dan Osborn:            My name is Dan Osborn. I am BCTGM Local 50G president here in Omaha, Nebraska. Maximillian Alvarez:        Well, Dan, thank you so much for making time to sit down and chat with me. I know you’ve got a lot going on. You’ve been on the picket line all weekend and you are coordinating shifts for folks who are on the line 24 hours a day. So again, really, really appreciate you taking the time to do this, man, and– Dan Osborn:            Well, thank you for having me on, I appreciate it. Maximillian Alvarez:        Of course. And I figured we could start by maybe turning things over to you and asking if you could give listeners and viewers a bit of a breakdown of kind of what led to this strike. I suppose it’s obviously something that is affecting plants across the US. And so if you could give us kind of a general picture and background of the strike, and then maybe talk a bit about how things have been going over there at your local in Omaha. \n",

Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich observed Wednesday that with employees in industries across the spectrum set to strike in the coming days following corporate leaders’ failure to meet their demands for fair pay and working conditions, the US is closer than it has been in decades to experiencing a general strike. “You might say workers have declared a national general strike until they get better pay and improved working conditions,” wrote Reich in The Guardian. “No one calls it a general strike. But in its own disorganized way it’s related to the organized strikes breaking out across the land—Hollywood TV and film crews, John Deere workers, Alabama coal miners, Nabisco workers, Kellogg workers, nurses in California, healthcare workers in Buffalo.” \n",

She carried a hand-made sign with the words “‘Essential’ Workers” in rainbow lettering and spoke about how little time she spends with her father during the year. “Work has taken up most of the time, so I don’t really get to see you a whole lot every day. That’s why I wanted to come here,” she said.  Emma was just one of many children of all ages standing with their parents on the picket line last weekend. Stephany Perez-Vergara also came out to support her mother, who has been employed at the plant for about a year. “I don’t really get to see my mom much,” she said. “It’s hard not to see your mom every day.” One striker I spoke with, who normally works the night shift, told me that his first day off since July was the first day of the strike. He had been working every day for three months straight. \n",

Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us. As we all know, there’s a battle raging on Capitol Hill. It could define the electoral future of this country. Progressives and what we call centrists are fighting over Biden’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan, and this thing called the Build Back Better legislation. Now, Biden’s appealed to progressives in this legislation, but progressives are now saying that the social spending to ensure the well-being of people must come first, before the vote on infrastructure. And what we call centrists are saying, it’s all too much money. And meanwhile the right wing, those obstructionists, are sitting in the wings salivating at the internal warfare and waiting to seize back electoral power. So, we continue our series of conversations about how to stop the racist right wing from taking over once again. And today, we look at what’s happening in Congress with our three guests: Max Sawicky, he’s a writer, an economist, he wrote an analysis of all this for In These Times; Karen Dolan is project director for Criminalization of Race and Poverty at the Institute for Policy Studies; and Bill Fletcher Jr. is a longtime union activist, writer, and organizer, whose latest work is The Man Who Fell From the Sky. Welcome all of you, good to have you with us So, I think what we’re facing here now, between Congress in this battle over these two different bills and what they mean, most of America is very confused by it. Most of America doesn’t even know what the hell is going on, they just see dysfunction on Capitol Hill. And a lot of it is being portrayed as the dysfunction of the left trying to destroy the government, least when you see how the New York Times frames it, and other journals were phrasing it. So, let’s break this down very quickly, and I want to really focus in on what this battle means politically for the future of this country. And Max, I want to start with you, because the piece you just wrote, I thought, really succinctly broke down what we’re facing. So, let me let you start. \n",

As we all know, there’s a battle raging on Capitol Hill. It could define the electoral future of this country. Progressives and what we call centrists are fighting over Biden’s $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan, and this thing called the Build Back Better legislation. Now, Biden’s appealed to progressives in this legislation, but progressives are now saying that the social spending to ensure the well-being of people must come first, before the vote on infrastructure. And what we call centrists are saying, it’s all too much money. And meanwhile the right wing, those obstructionists, are sitting in the wings salivating at the internal warfare and waiting to seize back electoral power. So, we continue our series of conversations about how to stop the racist right wing from taking over once again. And today, we look at what’s happening in Congress with our three guests: Max Sawicky, he’s a writer, an economist, he wrote an analysis of all this for In These Times; Karen Dolan is project director for Criminalization of Race and Poverty at the Institute for Policy Studies; and Bill Fletcher Jr. is a longtime union activist, writer, and organizer, whose latest work is The Man Who Fell From the Sky. Welcome all of you, good to have you with us So, I think what we’re facing here now, between Congress in this battle over these two different bills and what they mean, most of America is very confused by it. Most of America doesn’t even know what the hell is going on, they just see dysfunction on Capitol Hill. And a lot of it is being portrayed as the dysfunction of the left trying to destroy the government, least when you see how the New York Times frames it, and other journals were phrasing it. So, let’s break this down very quickly, and I want to really focus in on what this battle means politically for the future of this country. And Max, I want to start with you, because the piece you just wrote, I thought, really succinctly broke down what we’re facing. So, let me let you start. \n",

      " Content: In this special Indigenous Peoples’ Day episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with author and activist Ward Churchill about the wrongful imprisonment and deteriorating health of Indigenous political prisoner Leonard Peltier. A member of the American Indian Movement who was sent to prison in 1977 after a dubious trial sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences, Peltier’s continued imprisonment remains a stain on our “criminal justice” system. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Cameron Granadino Eddie Conway:    Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. We want to take a minute to look at the situation of a political prisoner that belongs to the Indigenous population, Leonard Peltier. We did some stories on him in the past. We just wanted to update his case in recognition of the National Indigenous Day. And so joining me is professor Ward Churchill to give us an update. Professor, thanks for joining me. Ward Churchill:    My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Eddie Conway:    It’s been a year since we talked about Leonard Peltier, and his health conditions, and his case. Can you just briefly update us, give us an overview first so that the audience can know where we are with that situation? Ward Churchill:    Well, Leonard remains in Coleman Prison, federal prison, in Florida, which is basically a supermax. It’s not somehow the super, supermax level they have in Colorado. But a supermax nonetheless, on a level with Marion, for example, which is where they originally sent him. Although he was not even qualified, actually, according to their criteria, to be sent there. He went straight from trial to Marion, to a supermax. He’s still there. They’re no longer on lockdown, although there was an extended lockdown not long ago. \n",

      " Content: There’s been a lot of news this week—so much news, in fact, that one of the biggest global stories in recent memory has seemingly gotten buried under the deluge of headlines. Just days ago, as Brett Wilkins writes, “what’s being called the ‘biggest-ever leak of offshore data’” involved the publication of “a cache of nearly 12 million documents” exposing “the hidden wealth, secret dealings, and corruption of hundreds of world leaders, billionaires, public officials, celebrities, and others.” Like the Panama Papers (2016) and the Paradise Papers (2017), the Pandora Papers leak provides definitive evidence that the super-rich are ripping all of us off, siphoning inordinate amounts of wealth away from our societies, stashing it for themselves, and using their power and influence to rig political and economic systems in their favor. In the second segment of this week’s Marc Steiner Show, Marc and Chuck Collins from the Institute for Policy Studies walk listeners through the importance of the Pandora Papers leak, what the documents reveal, and what we can do to stop the pillaging of our societies by the super-rich. Chuck Collins is the director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, where he co-edits the IPS website Inequality.org. He is also the author of Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good. Tune in for new segments of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:        Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News, I’m Marc Steiner. And as usual, it’s great to have you all with this. All of us by now are aware of this series of articles being put out by hundreds of newspapers across the globe about the Pandora Papers, and opening Pandora’s box, as it would. And this is an amazing moment, actually. This was created by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. It involves 600 journalists from around the globe. And they looked through 11.9 million documents that look at the flow of money and assets, how we obscure things and hide things, conceal things, through an offshore financial system. The Washington Post was part of this. The Guardian was part of this. \n",

Last week, Chevron finally secured judicial retaliation against Steven Donziger, the human rights lawyer who helped secure a historic $9.5 billion judgment against the company ten years earlier over their pollution of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. After an unprecedented 787 days in pretrial home detention, Donziger was sentenced last Friday to a maximum six months in prison for contempt of court by Loretta Preska, judge for the Southern District of New York, who said that “only the proverbial two-by-four between the eyes will instill in him any respect for the law.” [Judge Loretta Preska’s] conduct had been a focal point of the trial ever since she was, against local rules, handpicked to oversee the case by judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the Chevron-invested former tobacco industry lawyer who had blocked the judgement against the company and launched the contempt case. \n",

      " Content: Just weeks ago, as we reported previously on The Real News, onlookers in the US and around the world were horrified yet again by scenes of pain, desperation, and brutality at the US-Mexico border in Del Rio, Texas. With COVID-19 and global vaccine apartheid continuing to exacerbate a public health crisis, with continuing political turmoil following the assassination of former president Jovenel Moïse in July, and after another devastating earthquake shook the battered nation in August, thousands of Haitian refugees have been forced to leave their homes in the hope of seeking asylum in the US. Instead of having their appeals for asylum heard and their situation recognized for thecrisis of humanity that it is, these refugees were met by menacing US Border Patrol agents on horseback who rode them down and rounded them up in brutal fashion. Since then, the US government under President Joe Biden has deployed the Trump-era Title 42 policy to mass expel thousands of refugees back to Haiti without hearing their asylum claims, even though the Department of Homeland Security designated Haiti for Temporary Protected Status in May. While the news cycle has moved on from the immediate so-called “crisis at the border,” the nightmare for Haitians and the country of Haiti is still very much ongoing. In this interview, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez talks with Pascal Robert about the larger political context that led to the horrifying scenes at the US-Mexico border last month, and about the deep disdain, fear, and imperialist designs that have historically shaped US policy toward Haiti and its people. Pascal Robert is an essayist and political commentator whose work covers Black politics, global affairs, and the history and politics of Haiti. He is the co-host of the podcast THIS IS REVOLUTION, a frequent contributor to the Black Agenda Report, and his writing has been featured in outlets like The Huffington Post, Alternet, and the Washington Spectator.

      "Title: ﻿Immigration law firm uses ‘gig economy’ model to bludgeon union drive \n",
      " Author: Jaisal Noor \n",
      " Date: 2021-10-07 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: While the ‘gig economy’ was originally pitched as a way to boost pay and flexibility for workers, it has long been criticized as a method for companies to replace full-time workers with underpaid, overworked contractors who have fewer labor protections. And it’s not just rideshare drivers and delivery workers feeling the impact—the gig model is spreading to other industries. Right now, for instance, workers at the Hudson immigration law firm say their employer is using the gig economy model to undermine their union drive and become the first law firm to operate entirely on a contractor-based employment model. “I’ve long worried that the exploitative practices of Uber would spread to other industries, and we see exactly that happening at Hudson Legal,” professor Veena Dubal, a leading scholar of the gig economy, told the Real News. “The decision to move to using independent contractors, instead of full-time employees, should be understood as an attack on labor rights. Not only does this bring precarity into a stable workforce, it also is a not-so-subtle restructuring to avoid having to deal with organized labor and a future union.” In this interview for the TRNN podcast, Jaisal Noor speaks with two workers currently employed by Hudson about the company’s working conditions and union-busting efforts, as well as the ongoing organizing campaign by workers. Out of fear of reprisal from Hudson, these employees spoke with TRNN under the condition of anonymity, and their names and voices have been disguised. Jaisal Noor:    This is The Real News. I’m Jaisal Noor. From the beginning, the gig economy was pitched as a way for workers to “Be their own boss, to disrupt traditional business models, and to have the freedom and flexibility to do the work they want, when they want, and make good money in the process.” But soon after Uber’s much hyped launch a decade ago, critics warned the gig economy was failing to deliver on its promises. And, instead of empowering workers, gig work created massive windfalls for investors and CEOs while robbing employees of workplace protections and living wages. Now, workers at one of the nation’s largest immigration law firms say their bosses are using the gig economy to suppress their union drive. Gig workers are considered independent contractors, not employees, and often don’t have the right to organize. Workers at Hudson, a law firm specializing in employment-based immigration, say managers have also used traditional union busting tactics: Retaliating against employees who are unionizing, including firing two workers. \n",

      " Content: Just about every year, like clockwork, the issue of raising the federal debt ceiling generates apocalyptic and platitude-filled proclamations of impending doom from politicians, as well as breathless coverage by the mainstream press. Then, in the blink of an eye, lawmakers inevitably raise the debt ceiling and the issue disappears down the national memory hole as the news cycle moves on. Rest assured, the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling would be catastrophic, and with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning Congress that the federal government will run out of cash and extraordinary measures by Oct. 18, the clock is ticking. So why is this issue even up for debate? Why do we need to have an apocalyptic partisan showdown almost every year over raising the debt ceiling, a procedure that used to be entirely mundane and uncontroversial? In this interview for the TRNN podcast, Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez and political scientist Ed Burmila try to answer three basic questions for listeners: What the hell is the debt ceiling? Why is it a constant source of political anxiety? And should we care about it? Ed Burmila is a writer and political analyst whose work has appeared in outlets like The Nation, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, The Baffler, and the Chronicle of Higher Education. He’s been publishing the popular blog ginandtacos.com since 2003, he hosts a companion podcast called Mass for Shut-Ins, and he is currently finishing a book that will be published in September 2022 with Bold Type Books on why the Democratic Party is stuck in a cycle of making the same mistakes. Maximillian Alvarez:    Welcome, everyone, to The Real News Network podcast. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News. It’s great to have you with us. So, even those who study DC politics for a living have had a hard time figuring out just what the hell is going on on Capitol Hill right now. Over the past week, Beltway news has been dominated by the possibility of a government shutdown as well as the Democrats’ inter-party fight over infrastructure and the Build Back Better Act, which would make good on a whole host of campaign promises from President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, but is being opposed and possibly tanked by members of their own party. \n",

I need to repress, erase, and hide my Arab lifestyle and assimilate into European notions of Jewishness.” In the first segment of this week’s Marc Steiner Show, we bring you the latest installment of our ongoing series “Not in Our Name,” which highlights the diverse voices of Jewish activists, artists, intellectuals, and others who are speaking out against the Israeli occupation. In this installment, Marc talks with Cohen about living as an Arab Jew in Israel’s “racial caste system,” and about the crisis of spirituality underpinning Israel’s militarist occupation. Hadar Cohen is a Mizrahi feminist multi-media artist, Jewish mystic, healer, and educator. She is the founder of Feminism All Night, a project that designs communal immersive learning experiences about feminism and spirituality.  Tune in for new segments of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN.

And welcome to another edition of our series Not in Our Name, where we talk with Jews from across the globe who say that the occupation and the oppression of Palestinians must end. We cannot allow it to happen in our name. This is not who we are, and after you’ve suffered so much oppression, we have to live it differently. And today, we talk with Hadar Cohen, who traces her family back 10 generations in Jerusalem. She’s a Mizrahi feminist, multimedia artist, healer, educator, a mystic. She’s written and spoken extensively on what it means to be both Arab and Jewish. And in spiritual, cultural, and political frameworks and realms, she speaks about how you create these de-colonial frameworks, an end to Zionist oppression of Palestinians and Arab Jews. And she’s someone who wrestles deeply what it means to be both Arab and Jewish in a land where Europeans have defined those definitions. She founded Feminism All Night, a project that designs communal immersive learning experiences about feminism and spirituality, and her artistic world is just wide. Performance, movement, writing, weaving sounds and more together, and joins us here today. And welcome, Hadar. Good to have you with us. \n",

      " Content: Last weekend, tens of thousands of members of the International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. With 89.66% of eligible members participating and 98% voting to authorize the strike, the vote could lead 60,000 workers to walk off the job and bring the entertainment industry to a halt. As consumers, we tend to associate the entertainment industry with acting stars, elite directors and producers, and big studio executives, but hundreds and and even thousands of workers make every production possible, and many of them are grossly underpaid, overworked, and denied basic necessities like breaks and time to sleep between shifts. Combined with the explosion of streaming services and ever-increasing demands for studio-quality productions, workers in the entertainment industry are being run into the ground, and they have reached a breaking point.﻿ IATSE represents over 150,000 technicians, artisans, and craftspersons in the entertainment industry, including live theatre, motion picture and television production, broadcast, and trade shows in the United States and Canada. The union is composed of many different locals, not all of which are currently voting to authorize a strike. According to Deadline, “there are actually two separate strike authorization votes going on—one among the union’s 13 Hollywood production locals covered by the Basic Agreement, and the other covering 23 different locals outside Los Angeles who work under the Area Standards Agreement.” In this special Working People episode, recorded on Oct. 1, while the strike authorization vote was taking place, we talk to a panel of IATSE members and hear firsthand about the work they do, the unfair working conditions they’re fighting against, and the significance of the strike vote.

Well, welcome, everyone, to another episode of Working People. A podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of the working class today. Brought to you in partnership with In These Times magazine and The Real News Network, produced by Jules Taylor, and supported entirely by listeners like you. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the host of Working People and the editor-in-chief here at The Real News, and we’ve got a really special edition of the podcast for you all today. So, we are recording this panel conversation on Friday, Oct. 1, which is a very important day. If you haven’t heard, starting today, tens of thousands of members of the International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees, or IATSE, will begin voting on whether or not to authorize a strike by the union. Which, if passed, could lead 60,000 workers to walk off the job and bring the entertainment industry to a halt. Because let’s not forget, it is the workers who make this industry run, and it is the workers who have the power to halt production if they are not treated with the respect, fairness, and dignity that they deserve. According to a press release put out by the union on Sept. 21, “After months of negotiating successor contracts to the producer IATSE Basic Agreement and the Theatrical and Television Motion Picture Area Standards Agreement, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers of the AMPTP announced Monday that it does not intend to make any counteroffer to the IATSE’s most recent proposal. Throughout the bargaining process, the AMPTP has failed to work with us on addressing the most grievous problems in their workplaces, including: Excessively unsafe and harmful working hours; unlivable wages for the lowest paid crafts; consistent failure to provide reasonable rest during meal breaks, between work days, and on weekends; workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters.” So, we have convened this special panel with union members to talk about all this and make sure folks out there understand the circumstances that led to this historic strike vote, what workers in the entertainment industry have been going through before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what everyone listening can do to show support. And we are recording this conversation for the Working People podcast, but we will also be running a video version of this episode over at The Real News Network YouTube channel. So if you want to see the video version, go check it out there. So once again, thank you all for joining us.

According to a press release put out by the union on Sept. 21, “After months of negotiating successor contracts to the producer IATSE Basic Agreement and the Theatrical and Television Motion Picture Area Standards Agreement, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers of the AMPTP announced Monday that it does not intend to make any counteroffer to the IATSE’s most recent proposal. Throughout the bargaining process, the AMPTP has failed to work with us on addressing the most grievous problems in their workplaces, including: Excessively unsafe and harmful working hours; unlivable wages for the lowest paid crafts; consistent failure to provide reasonable rest during meal breaks, between work days, and on weekends; workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters.” So, we have convened this special panel with union members to talk about all this and make sure folks out there understand the circumstances that led to this historic strike vote, what workers in the entertainment industry have been going through before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what everyone listening can do to show support. And we are recording this conversation for the Working People podcast, but we will also be running a video version of this episode over at The Real News Network YouTube channel. So if you want to see the video version, go check it out there. So once again, thank you all for joining us. And without further ado, let’s go around the table and get to know our wonderful panelists today. Marisa Shipley:    Thank you for having me. My name is Marisa Shipley. My pronouns are she/her. I am a freelance art department coordinator working in TV and film in Los Angeles, California, and I am the vice-president of IATSE Local 871, which represents a lot of majority and historically female crafts affected by huge pay inequity in the industry. David McMahon:    I’m David McMahon. I use he/him pronouns. I’m in the New York Local 52 of IATSE in the shop craft department. Fae Weichsel:    My name is Fae Weichsel.

      " Content: It’s been five years since then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick (in)famously kneeled during the national anthem in protest of the systemic oppression of Black people and people of color in the US. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick famously explained. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” In his new book, The Kaepernick Effect: Taking a Knee, Changing the World, author Dave Zirin explores the historical valences of Kaepernick’s game-changing protest—from the long tradition of athletes making powerful political statements that preceded Kaepernick to the many athletes who have been inspired by Kaepernick and are carrying on that tradition today. In this installment of The Marc Steiner Show, Marc talks with Zirin about his new book and the political and cultural significance of “The Kaepernick Effect.” Dave Zirin is the sports editor for The Nation, where he also hosts The Nation’s Edge of Sports podcast. Along with The Kaepernick Effect, he is the author of ten books on the politics of sports and a frequent guest on ESPN, MSNBC, and Democracy Now! Tune in for new segments of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Pre-Production/Studio/Post-Production: Stephen Frank Marc Steiner:    Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News Network. I’m Marc Steiner and it’s great to have you on with us once again. We all know by now this term, taking a knee. Colin Kaepernick and hundreds of others are taking the knee, saying no to oppression, taking a knee on George Floyd’s neck, watching Derek Chauvin’s knee choking the life out of another Black person in this country, taking a knee to protest racism and oppression. It’s not the same as taking a knee to yield, to be knighted, to oppress. He’s taking a knee to stand up. And our guest today, Dave Zirin, a friend, colleague, who I’ve interviewed numerous times over the years has written a new book called The Kaepernick Effect: Taking a Knee, Changing the World. And Dave, welcome back. Good to have you with us. Dave Zirin: Marc, it’s great to be here. Thanks for having me. Marc Steiner:    So it really is true. I mean, this idea of taking a knee. Dave Zirin: Yeah. Marc Steiner:    And what your book did, and we’ll get in some specifics about it shortly, but it’s the idea of how what Colin Kaepernick did has spread. It’s become a symbol. It’s become a piece of what people do to say, “Enough is enough.” And I had no idea until I read this how pervasive it was across the country. Dave Zirin: Absolutely. And it’s completely universal, Marc. I mean, if I was in any city, in any setting, whether it was a town county fair or whether it was an NFL game, and the anthem played and I chose to take a knee everybody around me would immediately know what it was in reference to. No one would think I had lost a contact lens [Marc laughs]. No one would think I was saying a prayer. They would say, “Oh, that’s a protest. That’s a protest against racial inequity and police brutality. And that is a protest about the gap between what we’re told this country represents and the lived experiences of far too many people.” That’s the power of the knee. \n",

      " Content: Both Maryland’s governor Larry Hogan and Maryland’s comptroller Peter Franchot are boasting about how they didn’t spend the state’s entire budget during the last fiscal year—a world-changing twelve months that left many Marylanders on edge about the pandemic and their economic futures. It was announced this week that Maryland has a $2.5 billion surplus for last fiscal year. That’s more than 5% of the state’s $48 billion budget. That surplus, by the way, can be directly attributed to aid Maryland and Marylanders received from the federal government, which included three stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits, advanced child tax credit, and more. And yet, Hogan is seizing on the opportunity to take a victory lap, framing the budget surplus as a result of his “fiscally responsible” Republican governance. “I was elected governor to rein in years of out-of-control spending in Annapolis, to eliminate the $5.1 billion structural deficit we inherited, and to turn around our state’s floundering economy,” Hogan said in a press release. “This historic surplus is further proof we have done exactly that.” Franchot, the state comptroller—who is running for governor—also touted the budget surplus, though he focused on how that money could be used in the future as opposed to celebrating the fact that it wasn’t used at all. \n",

      " Content: In late 2017, Erimius Spencer was knocking on a neighbor’s door in his apartment building when officers Michael Amiott and Shane Rivera approached him. Without probable cause, they asked Spencer if they could search him for weapons and, having no weapons on him, Spencer allowed the search to proceed. Then the officers told him he was under arrest. When Spencer asked why he was being arrested, he was kicked in his eye and groin, and tased several times while lying on the ground handcuffed. Along with the cases investigated in Part I and Part II of the State of Injustice mini-documentary series, Spencer’s arrest is yet another tragic example of a demonstrated pattern of brutality by local police against Black residents of Euclid, Ohio. In the third and final installment of this series, executive produced by Black Lives Matter Cleveland, filmmakers Roger Glenn Hill and Brian Douglas continue to document this pattern of brutality by investigating Euclid PD’s treatment of Erimius Spencer as well as multiple cases of officers callously deploying pepper spray on large groups of unsuspecting teenagers. These cases provide further proof of the extent to which Black residents in Euclid, Ohio, routinely find themselves over-policed in their homes, schools, and even their skating rinks. \n",

In a simultaneous referendum on nationalizing the housing stock of large corporate landlords in Berlin, voters sent an unambiguous message to the entire republic.

      " Content: For many around the world who consider the United States to be all powerful, the ignominious end to the war in Afghanistan, the harried withdrawal of US troops, and the swift takeover by the Taliban were shocking sights to behold. While horrifying images of Afghans desperately trying to flee the capital city of Kabul have gradually faded from the news cycle, many crucial questions still need to be answered. What was the 20-year war really about? How credible is the US claim that its withdrawal from Afghanistan is part of a larger foreign policy shift to focusing on the “China challenge”? What future lies ahead for the people of Afghanistan and the Taliban? And how are Afghanistan’s neighbors, including Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan, responding to the US withdrawal? In Part I of this extended interview, TRNN contributor Radhika Desai and Melkulangara Bhadrakumar dissect the history and aftermath of the US war in Afghanistan. In Part II of this extended interview, Desai and Bhadrakumar discuss the future of Afghanistan and how Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan are filling the geopolitical vacuum left by US withdrawal. A former career diplomat in the Indian Foreign Service for three decades, MK Bhadrakumar was stationed in the former Soviet Union as well as South Korea, Sri Lanka, Germany, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, and Turkey. After retiring from his last post, he has been a prominent writer and analyst, focusing on India’s foreign policy as well as regional and global affairs, particularly relating to China, Russia, Central Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia. Radhika Desai:            After the two decades-long US occupation of Afghanistan, what lies ahead? Will Afghanistan descend into another chaotic breeding ground for terrorists, as alleged by many in the West? Or will it finally, rid of a corrupt and murderous occupation, be able to determine its destiny as many hope, if very cautiously? Hello, this is Radhika Desai for the Real News Network. To a world used to considering the US an all-powerful power, its sudden and ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the equally swift collapse of the government and army it had propped up for decades, was stunning. Few doubt that these events will constitute a major milestone, and likely margin acceleration of the long, drawn out process of US decline. No one watching the events as they have unfolded over the past months and more can doubt that they will have vast implications for Afghanistan, for the region, and for the world. There has already been a flood of commentary around the world offering different perspectives on key questions: Why did the US withdraw? How could the Taliban take over so swiftly and so bloodlessly? How could the US have occupied Afghanistan for 20 years, only to return it to the very forces it had fought so hard? How credible was the US claim that it was withdrawing from Afghanistan in order to concentrate on the China challenge, if the US presence in Afghanistan was a key piece of essentially creating problems for China, particularly given that Afghanistan borders on Xinjiang? On September the 7th, after putting down a local revolt in the Panjshir Valley, the Taliban announced a new government, which many countries are ready to deal with. So now it is time to distill the wisdom of the debate and discussion so far on the US withdrawal and look to the future. Where does Afghanistan go from here? What is the social character of the new government and state? What new relations and realities are emerging on the ground in Afghanistan? What new international alliances and equations are appearing? Particularly, how are Afghanistan’s neighbors, which include China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, and the Central Asian republics of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, not to mention the Shanghai Cooperation Agreement? How are all these entities relating to the new Taliban government? Will they permit the US to re-enter Afghanistan, as important forces in the United States hope? If not, can the much talked about over-the-horizon capability the US claims actually work for its purposes? What is the effect of all this on India, which in recent decades has been trying to position itself as the US’s loyal servant in the region, particularly as its counterweight to China, not to mention India’s long standing rivalry with Pakistan? With me to discuss all this is M. K. Bhadrakumar. It is no exaggeration to say that he’s one of the most qualified to speak on the matter. He was a career diplomat representing India in many of the countries of the region, and he’s one of the most widely read bloggers on foreign policy issues through his blog, Indian Punchline. Most recently, he has written a 20-part commentary on the evolving situation in Afghanistan. M. K. Bhadrakumar was posted to the capitals of the former Soviet Union, and was head of the Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan division and Kashmir unit of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. After retiring from his last posting in Turkey nearly two decades ago, he has been a writer and columnist, and has contributed to Indian and foreign publications. He writes on India’s foreign policy, regional, and global affairs with a focus on China, Russia and Central Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia. He currently divides his time between New Delhi and his hometown in South India. Welcome to The Real News Network, Bhadra. Bhadrakumar Melkulangara:    Thank you, Radhika. It’s a pleasure. And it’s a great privilege to be interviewed by you, a great scholar I have always regarded and respected. Thank you. Radhika Desai:            Thank you very much. Bhadra, let’s begin with an overview of where the [last] couple of months have left the United States in Afghanistan. And once we’ve laid that groundwork, we’ll be ready to talk about the future of Afghanistan and the region as it is being remade, and what all that implies for the world order. So my first question to you is, what were the causes and the significance of the US withdrawal when all is said and done, if you were to give us a synoptic view of what it means and why it happened, please? Bhadrakumar Melkulangara:    That’s great. It’s a long story in the sense that we must go back to the genesis of it, which is how the invasion of Afghanistan began. This was really an accidental war, in the sense that the New American Century, which was being planned at that time by the neocons in the US and senior officials in the Bush administration. They had in the crosshairs, actually, three other countries: that is Iran, Syria and Iraq. Not Afghanistan. Then the 9/11 attacks came, and the Bush administration was so much on the defensive domestically, that it had to be seen as doing something. And that’s the beginning, that this intervention had originally to bribe or pay the Northern Alliance field commanders and warlords and get them to do the job to overthrow the Taliban regime. The fact of the matter is that the Taliban had sent overtures to the US, that on this week’s question of Osama bin Laden’s handing over, they were prepared to negotiate. That was an offer from Mullah Omar himself. \n",

      " Content: This article originally appeared in Labor Notes on Sept. 27, 2021. It is shared here with permission. United Auto Workers members will soon vote in an unprecedented referendum to decide whether the union’s 400,000 working members and nearly 600,000 retirees will directly elect their top officers. Ballots hit the mail Oct. 19 and are due back Nov. 29. The UAW’s executive officers are currently elected to four-year terms by delegates at its convention. An “Administration Caucus” has dominated these positions for the past seven decades, using the powers of appointment available to International officers to wield tight political control. In the auto industry, where most UAW members work, many are frustrated with years of concessionary contracts that have allowed automakers to build a two-tier workforce, with the number of temporary and lower-paid workers ballooning. “Two-tier was the worst thing,” says Mark Gevaart, who works at GM’s Fort Wayne Assembly and is a former president of Local 2209. “I work right across the line with someone making half my wage. How do we deal with that?” For Will Hughes, a line worker at Ford’s Kansas City Assembly and member of Local 249, the referendum is about making leaders answer for the conditions members face on the job. “Right now there’s no accountability for these guys under the current delegate system,” Hughes said. “No one ever gets tossed out for doing a bad job on these contracts.” \n",

Committing “human rights violations” that have been condemned worldwide, US Border Patrol and the Biden administration are denying thousands of Haitians their internationally recognized right to seek asylum and utilizing a despicable Trump-era policy to mass expel refugees—with truly dizzying scope and speed—back to the same country it marked for Temporary Protected Status only months ago. This whole saga has made clear once again that the cruelty of US “immigration policy” and enforcement is unabashedly bipartisan. Moreover, it is a reminder that Haitians will continue to be denied basic humanitarian support from countries like the US which are directly and indirectly responsible for many of the crises plaguing Haiti. To discuss these issues, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez speaks with Dr. Ron Daniels, founder and president of the Institute of the Black World 21st Century and founder of the Haiti Support Project. Maximillian Alvarez:    Welcome everyone to The Real News Network. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News, and it’s great to have you all with us. Last week, onlookers around the US and around the world were horrified to see US Border Patrol’s inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees attempting to cross the US-Mexico border to seek asylum. Just months ago, in May in fact, the Department of Homeland Security designated Haiti for temporary protected status, meaning that the US government under President Joe Biden officially considers the Caribbean nation too unsafe for people to return there by their own definition. Since that announcement was made, Haiti’s former President Jovenel Moïise was assassinated in Port-au-Prince by foreign mercenaries, which has deepened the continuing political turmoil. COVID-19 and the global vaccine apartheid have exacerbated a public health crisis, and another devastating earthquake shook the battered nation in August. If anything, the compounding crises facing the people of Haiti have only gotten worse since May, prompting the mass flow of asylum-seeking refugees to the US-Mexico border. And yet, the United States has responded to the tremendous human pain and need of Haitian refugees with the same unfathomable cruelty our country is renowned for. Committing human rights violations that have been condemned worldwide, US Border Patrol and the Biden administration are denying thousands of Haitians their internationally recognized right to seek asylum, and they’re utilizing a despicable Trump-era policy to mass expel refugees with truly dizzying scope and speed back to the very same country that the US government had marked for temporary protected status months ago. \n",

Both of them are associate professors at the University of Miami, and they work with a project that follows the COVID-19 cases in the prison system. So thanks for joining me, Kathryn and Zinzi. Kathryn Nowotny:    Yeah, we’re glad to be here. Zinzi Bailey:    Thank you for having us. Eddie Conway:    Okay. Let’s start with Kathy, though. Can you talk for a minute about the rise in COVID-19 cases? Because there’s been newspaper reports saying that the COVID cases in the prison system is under reported, and that there’s a tremendous amount that the public don’t know about what’s going inside. Do you have any insight on that? \n",

At the center of this strategy is “focused deterrence,” an approach that involves telling “at-risk” people believed to be involved in many of the shootings in the city that law enforcement is aware of what they’re doing and encourages them to stop while offering resources to help them do so. “Today’s GVRS Partner Meeting represents BPD’s commitment to a comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence.

      " Content: The past month has been filled with anxious predictions and endless punditry concerning Canada’s snap election, which was called by Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and took place on Sept. 20. With a whopping total of 600 million Canadian dollars spent, the election was the most costly in Canada’s history, yet voter turnout was nearly at an all-time low and the net results left the political landscape looking practically the same as before. What was the point? What has changed? And what opportunities, if any, do the election results provide for progressives in Canada? In this installment of The Marc Steiner Show, Dimitri Lascaris joins Marc to break down the election results and to discuss how to break the iron grip of political stagnation in Canada. Lascaris is a lawyer, journalist, activist, and he was a candidate in the federalGreen Party leadership race in Canada, finishing second with just over 10,000 votes. He is also a longtime contributor and current board member at The Real News. Tune in for new segments of The Marc Steiner Show every Tuesday and Friday on TRNN. Marc Steiner:        Dimitri Lascaris. Welcome. Good to have you with us here on the show. Dimitri Lascaris:    It’s always great to talk to you, Marc. Thank you. Marc Steiner:        So, let me begin with just a broad question here for those listeners who are not in Canada, but maybe in the US or Europe or Africa, wherever they may be. How does it work in Canada where if a party wins a majority of the vote, they don’t win the election? Help us understand that first. Dimitri Lascaris:    Well, actually I would modify your question. What actually happens is that oftentimes parties don’t win a majority of the vote and they win a majority of the seats because we have- Marc Steiner:        Yes, correct. Right, right. Dimitri Lascaris:    So we have something called the first-past-the-post system, and it just basically means it’s a winner take all. Whoever gets the most vote in a riding which, in the American context, you would call that a congressional district, whoever gets the most gets a seat and everybody else gets nothing. So basically, we’ve got in some ridings 6, 7, 8 candidates running, and it’s possible to win the riding with somewhere between 25 to 35% of the vote. Some of them get an excess of 50%, but a lot of them, they get well under 50% of the vote and they get the seat and everybody else, all the other votes go to waste, basically. \n",

This week on PAR, we continue our ongoing investigation into the problem of rural overpolicing and provide a critical update on the killing of Tyler Rushing, which we reported on earlier in the year. Rushing’s case is yet another stark example of cops ignoring the needs of a civilian experiencing mental distress; instead, police brutally deployed a K-9, which bit him repeatedly, before shooting Rushing in the back of the head. Now, a police expert is speaking out, casting doubt on every action officers took the night Rushing died and raising more questions about the use of force by law enforcement and the untold consequences of abusing it. Taya Graham: Hello, my name is Taya Graham. And welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops; instead we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, we will achieve that goal with breaking news about a horrifying police killing in a small rural community, a tragic case that demonstrates just how above the law police actually are. But I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com. And please like, share, and comment on our videos, you know I read your comments and that I appreciate them. And of course, you can always reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And if you can, you can hit the Patreon donate link below in the comments. We have a Patreon, so if you feel inspired please feel free to click the link. Okay. Now we’ve gotten all that stuff out of the way.  Now, several months ago, we showed you this, one of the most horrifying body camera videos I have ever seen. It showed the torturous death of Tyler Rushing at the hands of Chico Police. It was the case we decided to highlight, not just because of its sheer brutality, but also due to the fact it was a prime example of the type of policing we have continued to report on: overpolicing in rural America. \n",

      " Content: Once again, the NYPD 67th Precinct in Flatbush had parked a car on the sidewalk. Again, neighborhood residents sprang into action, coordinating dialing 311 to lodge yet another complaint via WhatsApp chat groups. Commandeering public sidewalks to park police squad cars is one thing. Then, another wrecked car—instead of being taken to a tow lot— appeared on the same sidewalk by the Snyder Avenue station, as if a portal from a different dimension had opened in the sky, dumping battered and booted cars on this majority-Black and working-class section of Brooklyn.  Then, another wrecked car—instead of being taken to a tow lot— appeared on the same sidewalk by the Snyder Avenue station, as if a portal from a different dimension had opened in the sky, dumping battered and booted cars on this majority-Black and working-class section of Brooklyn. “The cops have taken over a majority of the blocks by putting abandoned, booted cars. So we’re hoping to see if they could take the booted cars and put them in a tow lot and clear up [parking] spaces for more of the residents,” said Adrian Césaire, 42, who has lived on Snyder Avenue for over 20 years.  The trash and wreckage of bashed-up cars left by the NYPD is not only an eyesore; it’s an affront amid pandemic-related budget cuts in 2020 totaling millions of dollars, which hurt both the jobs of union sanitation and municipal workers and left residents to clean up litter-strewn streets. While across the country states like Minnesota are pushing to enact ambitious reforms, including the disbanding of police departments, Brooklyn residents have more modest aims. They want the NYPD, whose budget is one of the largest in the nation, even after a modest reduction to $98.56 billion for the 2022 fiscal year, to stop trashing their neighborhood—another way, as far as residents are concerned, the NYPD makes their lives more difficult while displaying their contempt for Black working-class communities like Flatbush.  On a gray Saturday in August, I spot a black Mercedes sedan with tinted windows on that sidewalk, its bottom fender hanging off like a busted lip, the Mercedes-logo grill pressed up against the windshield. Next to it are a large dumpster, a white refrigerator, and two black office chairs with exposed padding.  \n",

Because he was wearing a colostomy bag, Wright was slow to comply, and officer Flagg tased him before he could explain his condition. Moreover, Wright was initially charged with obstruction, resisting arrest, and criminal trespassing—but those charges were all eventually dropped.

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. There’s been a lot of protests in Cuba. People have been arrested. Sanctions have been placed on officials by the United States government. There’s been a lot of talk by Biden about the conditions that prisoners are held in. And so we want to take this minute to look at the difference between the Cuban prison system and the United States prison system. According to experts that’s been studying the prison system, I don’t necessarily call myself one, but the differences are stark in contrast. One, there is no juvenile prison system, and that’s in Cuba. That’s a primary factor in whether or not adults end up in prison later on. In America, juveniles are locked up at the age of 10, 11, 12, 13. They get processed in the prison system and they continue to go on to get locked up for the rest of their life, in most cases. In Cuba, they look at juvenile behavior as one of young people that’s still learning and growing and their brain is developing, and so they have systems in place that address those needs and they don’t force young people into a life of prison and a life of incarceration. That’s one thing. I think another thing is, and it’s an important factor, is that life without parole, life sentences in general, are given out in the United States willy-nilly, and in Cuba, that’s not the case. They don’t have that kind of a system. They have a system that’s open and inclusive of developing the human spirit and the human connection to their community—Which means they engage in family visitation, they engage in furloughs, they engage in having the community involved in the prison process—Whereas in the United States, you have a prison system that locks people in a cage, separates them from their family, criminalize their families, for the most part, and tends to work to destroy their spirit and work to destroy their interest in being part of the community, because of the treatment that they end up receiving. In the United States, you have a prison system that’s a racist institution. It’s the largest prison system in the world. Everybody know it’s the worst prison system in the world. You have prisoners that have been put in solitary confinement, which is like in a nine by six cage with no windows, for 30 and 40 years. In Cuba, you don’t have solitary confinement, because that’s inhumane and people understand that. In the same way, if you look at the prison system in the United States, in relationship to women and childbearing, you’ll find that women, for the most part, when they are locked up and they have to give birth, they are shackled and chained to hospital beds. That’s unheard of in Cuba. Cuba would never think of dehumanizing that experience for a woman and a child coming into the world. So that’s a big contrast there. You have a system in America that, according to the 13th Amendment, authorizes slavery, and most prisoners work at slave wages, and most prisoners have no protection for human rights or for personal rights, medicine, et cetera. In Cuba, it’s just the opposite. And they get paid the same wages as people outside in the outside community get paid. That’s significant because it doesn’t diminish them or make them feel like slaves. The prison system isn’t used to exploit the Cuban population; It’s used to help heal whatever problems that might occur between the population. One of the things that Biden should be looking at is Guantanamo. The United States has the worst prison in the world. Everybody in the world knows that Guantanamo is the one place you don’t want to go. They, in fact, are the biggest violators of human rights on the planet. \n",

The goal of the legislation is to fight climate change by upgrading every public school in the country with green infrastructure, addressing historic inequities by focusing resources on high-need schools, providing resources to create culturally relevant curriculum, and funding the training of hundreds of thousands of additional educators.  “The Green New Deal for Public Schools represents the level of school infrastructure investment that is urgent and necessary to heal the harm from decades of disinvestment, redlining and cycles of poverty and trauma, particularly for Black and brown children,” Bowman said in a press release. \n",

Without announcing themselves as police officers or turning on their dashcams, Catalani and Rhodes aggressively tried to wrestle Stewart out of the car, escalating the situation with every passing second as Stewart panicked and put his car in drive. Within minutes, Stewart was on the ground, dead, with three bullets in his chest, one in his wrist, and a fatal shot to his neck.

      " Content: Back in June, the Baltimore City Council approved a $22 million budget increase to the Baltimore Police Department’s budget, going against the demands of hundreds of Baltimoreans who showed up for two taxpayers’ nights to tell Mayor Brandon Scott and members of Baltimore City Council, “defund the police.”  “That the City of Baltimore has to scramble together on two nights to say something and hope that it changes is not a participatory process,” Rob Ferrell of Organizing Black said at the time. As Battleground Baltimore previously reported, the budget increase was, at least in part, a done deal before Taxpayers’ Night. That’s because even if the council and the mayor had been motivated to vote “no” to an additional $22 million for the police, the federal consent decree likely would have fined the city for defunding. It is just one more example of how police are rewarded for their corruption and dysfunction, and the rest of the city loses. A consent decree imposed on the city after Freddie Gray died in police custody in 2015 now nullifies the will of the people and gives elected officials who don’t actually want to defund a convenient excuse.  \n",

John Bel Edwards—written by the Promise of Justice Initiative and signed by the ACLU of Louisiana, Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, and Voice of the Experienced, among others—the organizations requested that “the state provide an answer as to why these vulnerable residents were left in harm’s way, as well an assurance that in the future, confinement in a Louisiana prison or jail does not translate to a potential death sentence during a life-threatening major weather event.”  \n",

      " Content: On July 30, a Friday, Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni partially lifted the 42-day lockdown order that had been implemented in June amid a surge of COVID-19 infections in the country. Uganda’s total population is just over 45 million. The number of people in the target group prioritized for vaccination amounts to 21.9 million. At the time Museveni announced the partial lifting of the lockdown, less than 1.5% of those in that target group (only about 1.2 million) had received the recommended vaccines: According to Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, minister of health, 902,293 had received the first jab, while only 232,742 people were fully vaccinated. By the end of August, Uganda had only received roughly 2,025,280 vaccine doses, all donations: 1,725,280 through the COVAX scheme, as well as 300,000 Sinovac doses from China. Uganda, however, has not effectively reached a state of suppressed transmission of the coronavirus, which would mean the positivity rate drops to 5% or below. Having reached a staggering 19.2% positivity rate as of June 8, Uganda was still experiencing 7-8% positivity by July 30—there was still active transmission happening at the community level.  This is the reality still facing many countries around the world, especially in Africa, due to the global vaccine apartheid and forced scarcity engendered by rich countries hoarding doses and protecting the profits and intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies over the lives of the world’s population. But the government had to make a hard decision, opting to relax restrictions on trade, movement, and transport because the economy was bleeding and people had nothing to eat. “Literally speaking, if the opening up during the first wave represented a training drill under a mixture of blank and live shots, what we have loosed Ugandans onto is an actively raging battlefield,” said Dr. Misaki Wayengera, the chair of Uganda’s Scientific Advisory Committee on COVID-19 for the Ministry of Health.  \n",

      " Content: One of the largest transportation and logistics corporations in the world, XPO Logistics, recently created a spinoff company that will focus on warehouses and supply chains, while XPO Logistics will continue to focus more on transportation operations. Workers and unions argue that, despite the new name, GXO is continuing the same union opposition and mistreatment of workers as their predecessor.  The new corporation, GXO Logistics, officially went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 2 with 94,000 employees at 869 locations around the world. Even though many have not heard the name before, some of the largest and most high-profile brands outsource their warehouse and logistics needs to GXO, including Amazon, Home Depot, IKEA, Nestle, Peloton, Starbucks, Target, Verizon, and Walmart.  GXO executives claim the new company is leaving behind the “Dickensian warehouse” of the past through a reliance on technology and automation.  XPO Logistics has a long record of alleged worker mistreatment and exploitation. Workers and unions argue that these practices have carried over to the new company, whose split from XPO was billed as a way to generate value for shareholders. \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Jacobin on June 23, 2021, and is shared with permission from Jacobin. In August 1921, up to twenty thousand miners with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) amassed in Charleston, West Virginia, many armed with hunting rifles. They aimed to march southwest, to Mingo County, to free striking miners and their families, whom the coal bosses, in collusion with the state, had imprisoned and were attempting to starve out. But between the two groups of miners stood Blair Mountain, rising nearly two thousand feet above sea level. Atop the mountain, the local sheriff had dug in his own army of hundreds of deputies, armed with submachine guns and bombs, which were deployable via commandeered aircraft. The two sides battled for five days before federal troops put down the miners’ revolt. (“AIR FLEET ORDERED TO W. VA BATTLEFIELD / AVIATORS WILL DROP BOMBS ON MARCHERS” read the headline in the Washington Times.) It was the largest armed conflict since the Civil War and, to this day, the largest labor uprising in US history. \n",

      " Content: Update 8/25/2021: The original version of this article stated that Matthew Heimbach had “recently tried to participate in the Medicare for All March and was listed, briefly, as a keynote speaker” for a march that was scheduled to take place in Muncie, Indiana, in late July. Since the original publication of this story, individuals associated with the March for Medicaid For All have claimed on social media that, while the graphics team for the Muncie event was infiltrated, the infiltrator who placed Heimbach on the list of keynote speakers was a lone “troll” who acted independently and not in coordination with Heimbach himself. The official statement released on June 27 by the March organizers (which was linked in the original piece) condemns Heimbach and confirms that certain “Muncie organizers … purposely [sic] tried to derail and infiltrate our movement.” The statement also says that their Rules and Ethics Committee would be investigating what happened. There are currently no other public-facing statements from the organization about the results of this investigation.  While we have yet to view or receive incontrovertible proof of these claims, let alone incontrovertible proof that Heimbach was in no way involved with the infiltration effort, for clarity’s sake we have updated the story to reflect the fact that neither Heimbach nor people directly associated with him have been confirmed as the individual(s) behind the posting of his photo on the official March Instagram or his listing as a keynote speaker for the canceled event in Muncie. Disgraced fascist and violent white nationalist Matthew Heimbach has been re-entering political spaces—as a leftist. Heimbach has had good reason to keep a low profile of late: His neo-Nazi group, the Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP), imploded after a nonpartisan civil rights nonprofit filed a lawsuit against him regarding his involvement in the infamous Unite the Right rally held four years ago in Charlottesville. The TWP collapse was also hastened by a dramatic instance of domestic violence and inter-party sparring, as detailed in a 2018 police report. Now, sporting a “new” ideology and attempting to tie his past transgressions to his battle with alcoholism, Heimbach is looking to re-introduce himself, relaunch the dissolved TWP, and regain his prominence on the national stage.  I’ll be upfront: I have had a personal interest in Heimbach’s political trajectory ever since he and his fellow TWP members attacked me while I was protesting at a Trump rally in March of 2016. From a personal and a political standpoint, I have been deeply interested in understanding Heimbach’s appeal both for true believers of the far right and for morbidly curious onlookers. More than this, though, I have been especially interested in the rhetoric he uses (and how he uses it), which sometimes sounds closer to what you’d hear at a meeting of the Democratic Socialists of America than at a Klan rally. \n",

The Taliban’s rapid ascent came despite over $2 trillion spent on the US war effort, and an enormous loss of human life. The press has focused on the American toll—2,448 US soldiers and 3,846 contractors—but Afghans paid a far higher price: 47,245 civilians, 66,000 Afghan military and police, and 51,191 opposition fighters have been killed to date, according to the AP. \n",

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I never get tired of saying, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. Today we’re going to do so by reporting on a disturbing video out of a small town in California, where a deputy sheriff kicked a man prone on the ground and knocked him unconscious. Well, what happened after this assault occurred makes the story even more indicative of the theme of this show, because it’s how the system is handling this case that we will unpack and report on in detail. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. We have a Patreon for donations pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, one of the most troubling patterns in American policing is how often cops are above the laws they enforce, especially when it comes to discipline for bad behavior. A lack of holding officers accountable can often lead to more trouble down the road. What do I mean? Well, consider a case we reported on extensively before. It involved the death of a 19-year-old named Anton Black. Anton was walking with his cousin in September of 2018 in a small town called Greensboro on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore. A Karen called the police and falsely accused him of kidnapping a 12-year-old boy who accompanied him on his walk. It turns out that child was a relative, but that didn’t prevent the Greensboro police officer, Thomas Webster, from accosting Anton, as you can see here in this body camera footage. I have to warn you the video that follows of Anton being confronted, chased, tasered and choked by police is disturbing, so please fast forward through that footage if you don’t wish to see it. Webster chased Anton back to his mother’s home, where the young track star and aspiring model hid in a family car. Officer Webster, for reasons that still remain unknown, decided to escalate the situation by smashing the window, even though Anton did not present a threat, a move that led to this. Minutes later, a 200-pound police officer lying his body across Anton’s, an act which his lawyers say led to his death. But the reason I bring up this case today is due to what was learned after this tragic incident. That’s because as police stonewalled the probe into his death we learned that officer Webster had been involved in another high-profile case of police brutality. As you can see in this dash cam footage, Webster had kicked a man in the jaw, breaking it, during an arrest. The case led to charges of assault of which Webster was found not guilty. But even though Webster was implicated in at least a dozen other cases of brutality in Delaware, he was able to cross state lines and get a job as a cop in Maryland. The reason I bring this case up today is because of the video I’m showing you now. It involves another example of a cop using unnecessary force, and it’s also raising many of the same questions that officer Webster’s track record made clear. Can the system really hold police accountable? That is the question the lawyer for the man seen in this video is asking, after he was knocked unconscious by a San Bernardino county sheriff in May of 2020 during this arrest. As you can see here in the video, Willie Jones was complying with an officer’s order to lay on the ground after a chase that ended in Victorville, California. But for reasons that have yet to be explained, the cop kicked Mr. Jones in the face and head as he lay prone in a parking lot. So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation. In response to the alleged traffic violation, they were allegedly engaged or trying to engage in a traffic stop, and stated that Mr. Jones had avoided or fled their attempts to stop him. But, at any rate, Mr. Jones ended up at a car lot in Victorville, California, which was depicted actually in a videotape or video surveillance that was actually caught, I believe it was a security company that had a video surveillance of this car dealership. While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands. He had laid down on his stomach and spread his arms out and was no threat to the officers, was in compliance. The officer then just walked over to Mr. Jones and kicked him twice in the head and then placed him in handcuffs. Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes. Once he was actually taken to be treated medically, or taken to the emergency room, then he was taken back to a jail facility or a custodial facility. While he was at the custodial facility, within a very short period of time, he was approached by deputies who gave him some documents to actually sign. My understanding is that this is pretty routine for this particular department, being the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. They often do that with–I’ve even heard the situations where they try to get people to sign waivers while they’re still in hospital beds. But, at any rate, they approached him and gave him some documents to sign, trying to see if they would release his claims for $4,000. I do know that there are other cases–obviously those aren’t honored in most cases or in any cases that I know of–but they try to get people to sign. They send the [inaudible] and then whenever they cash the money, I guess they try to say that they entered into some sort of agreement, but yeah, that was what they attempted to do. Taya Graham: As a lawyer, do you think this is ethical? Zulu Ali: Absolutely not. I think that there’s a lot of problems with that. Clearly you’re dealing with someone, first of all, who is in custody. Second of all, someone who has actually been just treated medically, and within minutes of doing it they’re approached by deputy sheriffs. Oftentimes, I think that many of these cases are probably not even without the county’s knowledge. I don’t even know if the county council, or county, or at least many of the superiors, from my understanding, at least would admit that they know that they’re engaged in that type of conduct. But yeah, that’s extremely unethical. Taya Graham: What are the legal steps you’ve taken? For example, have you filed a lawsuit? Zulu Ali: Absolutely. Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved. Or, if it’s not resolved, then we will be filing a lawsuit in court. Taya Graham: What has happened to the officer, and do you think he should be disciplined for his actions? Zulu Ali: Yeah. He actually has been identified. I do believe that–right now, my understanding is he’s still on administrative leave. My understanding is it’s paid administrative leave, and they’re investigating. My understanding is also the district attorney’s office is in the process of determining whether criminal charges are going to be filed against the deputy. At least at this point I don’t believe that the Sheriff’s Department has completed their investigation, or at least publicly advised the results of the investigation being completed, or the disposition of that. We haven’t heard anything yet back from the district attorney’s office. But he definitely should be, I think he should be criminally charged. I think that what we observed was someone who was actually committing a crime, and he should be treated as such. I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy? Was he terminated, was he still on paid administrative leave? I also wanted to know if it’s standard practice to offer $4,000 to people who are subject to police abuse. How often does this happen? Is this what they always do? I also wanted to know when the internal investigation would be done, and if they’d be sharing results with the public. Those questions are outstanding, I will follow them, continuing. Taya Graham: Stephen, this is not the first time we’ve reported on the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in a possible case of police abuse. Can you talk a little bit about what we’ve uncovered before? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, let’s remember just a couple of weeks ago we reported on Daniel Alvarez getting harassed by this San Bernardino county sheriff. We have the video right here. He was pulled over for no reason, and then asked if he was on probation or parole, and then the guy pulled out his handcuffs. So, no, this seems to be a problem with them getting in trouble, and questionable arrests and questionable stops. Taya Graham: So, finally, we discussed the death of Anton Black and the fact that officer Thomas Webster, who initiated the stop, was able to get a job despite having an extensive record of citizen complaints. Can you tell us what happened and what we eventually learned? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, what we learned was it’s very easy for a police officer to shift jurisdictions, or go to a different city or town, and suppress their bad record in another place. Basically, the chief of Greensboro just left out all the bad complaints about officer Webster that he accrued in Delaware, and didn’t submit them as part of the application, even though that’s required by law. Webster was certified without any of that information. It turned out that he had to prosecute the chief for doing that, and he ended up pleading guilty to misconduct in office. But the lesson learned is that it’s very easy to subvert the process where officers can be held accountable for past actions. Taya Graham: It seems clear to me that holding this officer accountable for his actions is not just going to be difficult, but perhaps impossible. They actually tried to make an unethical deal with Mr. Jones shortly after the incident occurred, which means the likelihood the agency is going to do a fair and objective investigation certainly remains in doubt. But as the story unfolds, and the department makes excuses for the behavior of the cop in question, I’m reminded of a strategy law enforcement has used against us that might be worth considering as a tactic to ensure that cops don’t avoid consequences for their bad behavior, just like they say we shouldn’t either. Let’s call this idea putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing if it fits. What do I mean? Well, let’s start by recalling a police policy officers and the law enforcement establishment loves, but turned out not to be so popular with the people. I’m talking zero tolerance, a strategy that basically presumes everyone is guilty, and that even the most minor offenses, regardless of circumstance, should bear the full brunt of the law. The idea was rooted in an essay that was published in 1986 by two social sciences, they called it the broken windows theory. It posited that to root out crime in violent neighborhoods, it was important to enforce even the most petty offenses as harshly as possible. The reasoning was the authors argued, that minor crimes were like a building in disrepair, a sign to the community that their neighborhood was not just unlawful but dysfunctional. The theory was that by strenuously enforcing minor crimes you could send a signal to the more violent criminal that their behavior would not be tolerated. This led to the so-called zero tolerance strategy, a policing tactic that meant when you spit on the sidewalk, or drank a beer on your front porch, or urinated in an alley, you’re going to jail. In Baltimore, the strategy had devastating consequences. In a city of 600,000 people, nearly 100,000 people were arrested year in and year out for nearly a decade. Tens of thousands of people were charged illegally for drinking a beer on a stoop, or walking through a neighborhood where they didn’t live. The number of arrests were so absurd, a new term was coined, known as a walkthrough, which meant that people arrested would simply be walked through a central booking facility without actually being locked up, all because they’d simply arrested too many people to fit them in the facility. Much to the surprise of the politicians and police unions that touted the idea, this policy was not effective. The number of homicides stayed roughly the same, and today are worse now than ever. But the reason I bring this policy up is because maybe it’s time to give the institution that came up with this destructive policy a taste of their own medicine. So what exactly am I saying here? Well, how about we have zero tolerance for bad behavior by cops? Instead of paid vacations and promotions when they get into trouble, how about we charge them with the same minor crimes they forced upon us? How about getting suspended immediately without pay when a video like this surfaces? Or better yet, like the rest of us, fired? How about they get a ticket every time they forget to wear a seatbelt, or they get a criminal citation for not mowing their yard? Or how about they get suspended without pay–let me repeat, without pay–as any of us would in the first step of an internal investigation, not the last? Why not apply the same stringent laws to yourselves that you apply to us? Of course, I can hear the arguments from the police union now. Cops are only human, everyone makes mistakes. It’s the intent of the law, not the letter of the law, that matters. You can’t arrest your way out of a problem. Gee, where have I heard that before? An argument that was met with indifference and skepticism by police unions and partisans who urge law and order at all costs when zero tolerance was destroying people’s lives. Where was the call for humanity when the citizens of this country were subject to the strictest of enforcements of criminal law in the history of any nation? Who was asking for leniency when we became the larger incarcerator of human beings in the history of civilization? That’s why I think it might be worthwhile to apply the same standard to them as they do to us. Perhaps the officer pictured in the video should be fired first, and rehired if he’s proved innocent later. Let’s call it zero tolerance for bad police behavior. Why shouldn’t they be treated like us? Perhaps it will teach them a lesson that most of us already know. Enforcing the letter of the law has devastating consequences. Maybe it’s time for law enforcement to understand just how devastating that can be. I’d like to thank my guest, Mr. Zulu Ali, for joining us and explaining the details of this case. Thank you. Of course, I have to thank intrepid reporter Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing for the piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I never get tired of saying, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. Today we’re going to do so by reporting on a disturbing video out of a small town in California, where a deputy sheriff kicked a man prone on the ground and knocked him unconscious. Well, what happened after this assault occurred makes the story even more indicative of the theme of this show, because it’s how the system is handling this case that we will unpack and report on in detail. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. We have a Patreon for donations pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, one of the most troubling patterns in American policing is how often cops are above the laws they enforce, especially when it comes to discipline for bad behavior. A lack of holding officers accountable can often lead to more trouble down the road. What do I mean? Well, consider a case we reported on extensively before. It involved the death of a 19-year-old named Anton Black. Anton was walking with his cousin in September of 2018 in a small town called Greensboro on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore. A Karen called the police and falsely accused him of kidnapping a 12-year-old boy who accompanied him on his walk. It turns out that child was a relative, but that didn’t prevent the Greensboro police officer, Thomas Webster, from accosting Anton, as you can see here in this body camera footage. I have to warn you the video that follows of Anton being confronted, chased, tasered and choked by police is disturbing, so please fast forward through that footage if you don’t wish to see it. Webster chased Anton back to his mother’s home, where the young track star and aspiring model hid in a family car. Officer Webster, for reasons that still remain unknown, decided to escalate the situation by smashing the window, even though Anton did not present a threat, a move that led to this. Minutes later, a 200-pound police officer lying his body across Anton’s, an act which his lawyers say led to his death. But the reason I bring up this case today is due to what was learned after this tragic incident. That’s because as police stonewalled the probe into his death we learned that officer Webster had been involved in another high-profile case of police brutality. As you can see in this dash cam footage, Webster had kicked a man in the jaw, breaking it, during an arrest. The case led to charges of assault of which Webster was found not guilty. But even though Webster was implicated in at least a dozen other cases of brutality in Delaware, he was able to cross state lines and get a job as a cop in Maryland. The reason I bring this case up today is because of the video I’m showing you now. It involves another example of a cop using unnecessary force, and it’s also raising many of the same questions that officer Webster’s track record made clear. Can the system really hold police accountable? That is the question the lawyer for the man seen in this video is asking, after he was knocked unconscious by a San Bernardino county sheriff in May of 2020 during this arrest. As you can see here in the video, Willie Jones was complying with an officer’s order to lay on the ground after a chase that ended in Victorville, California. But for reasons that have yet to be explained, the cop kicked Mr. Jones in the face and head as he lay prone in a parking lot. So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation. In response to the alleged traffic violation, they were allegedly engaged or trying to engage in a traffic stop, and stated that Mr. Jones had avoided or fled their attempts to stop him. But, at any rate, Mr. Jones ended up at a car lot in Victorville, California, which was depicted actually in a videotape or video surveillance that was actually caught, I believe it was a security company that had a video surveillance of this car dealership. While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands. He had laid down on his stomach and spread his arms out and was no threat to the officers, was in compliance. The officer then just walked over to Mr. Jones and kicked him twice in the head and then placed him in handcuffs. Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes. Once he was actually taken to be treated medically, or taken to the emergency room, then he was taken back to a jail facility or a custodial facility. While he was at the custodial facility, within a very short period of time, he was approached by deputies who gave him some documents to actually sign. My understanding is that this is pretty routine for this particular department, being the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. They often do that with–I’ve even heard the situations where they try to get people to sign waivers while they’re still in hospital beds. But, at any rate, they approached him and gave him some documents to sign, trying to see if they would release his claims for $4,000. I do know that there are other cases–obviously those aren’t honored in most cases or in any cases that I know of–but they try to get people to sign. They send the [inaudible] and then whenever they cash the money, I guess they try to say that they entered into some sort of agreement, but yeah, that was what they attempted to do. Taya Graham: As a lawyer, do you think this is ethical? Zulu Ali: Absolutely not. I think that there’s a lot of problems with that. Clearly you’re dealing with someone, first of all, who is in custody. Second of all, someone who has actually been just treated medically, and within minutes of doing it they’re approached by deputy sheriffs. Oftentimes, I think that many of these cases are probably not even without the county’s knowledge. I don’t even know if the county council, or county, or at least many of the superiors, from my understanding, at least would admit that they know that they’re engaged in that type of conduct. But yeah, that’s extremely unethical. Taya Graham: What are the legal steps you’ve taken? For example, have you filed a lawsuit? Zulu Ali: Absolutely. Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved. Or, if it’s not resolved, then we will be filing a lawsuit in court. Taya Graham: What has happened to the officer, and do you think he should be disciplined for his actions? Zulu Ali: Yeah. He actually has been identified. I do believe that–right now, my understanding is he’s still on administrative leave. My understanding is it’s paid administrative leave, and they’re investigating. My understanding is also the district attorney’s office is in the process of determining whether criminal charges are going to be filed against the deputy. At least at this point I don’t believe that the Sheriff’s Department has completed their investigation, or at least publicly advised the results of the investigation being completed, or the disposition of that. We haven’t heard anything yet back from the district attorney’s office. But he definitely should be, I think he should be criminally charged. I think that what we observed was someone who was actually committing a crime, and he should be treated as such. I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy? Was he terminated, was he still on paid administrative leave? I also wanted to know if it’s standard practice to offer $4,000 to people who are subject to police abuse. How often does this happen? Is this what they always do? I also wanted to know when the internal investigation would be done, and if they’d be sharing results with the public. Those questions are outstanding, I will follow them, continuing. Taya Graham: Stephen, this is not the first time we’ve reported on the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in a possible case of police abuse. Can you talk a little bit about what we’ve uncovered before? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, let’s remember just a couple of weeks ago we reported on Daniel Alvarez getting harassed by this San Bernardino county sheriff. We have the video right here. He was pulled over for no reason, and then asked if he was on probation or parole, and then the guy pulled out his handcuffs. So, no, this seems to be a problem with them getting in trouble, and questionable arrests and questionable stops. Taya Graham: So, finally, we discussed the death of Anton Black and the fact that officer Thomas Webster, who initiated the stop, was able to get a job despite having an extensive record of citizen complaints. Can you tell us what happened and what we eventually learned? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, what we learned was it’s very easy for a police officer to shift jurisdictions, or go to a different city or town, and suppress their bad record in another place. Basically, the chief of Greensboro just left out all the bad complaints about officer Webster that he accrued in Delaware, and didn’t submit them as part of the application, even though that’s required by law. Webster was certified without any of that information. It turned out that he had to prosecute the chief for doing that, and he ended up pleading guilty to misconduct in office. But the lesson learned is that it’s very easy to subvert the process where officers can be held accountable for past actions. Taya Graham: It seems clear to me that holding this officer accountable for his actions is not just going to be difficult, but perhaps impossible. They actually tried to make an unethical deal with Mr. Jones shortly after the incident occurred, which means the likelihood the agency is going to do a fair and objective investigation certainly remains in doubt. But as the story unfolds, and the department makes excuses for the behavior of the cop in question, I’m reminded of a strategy law enforcement has used against us that might be worth considering as a tactic to ensure that cops don’t avoid consequences for their bad behavior, just like they say we shouldn’t either. Let’s call this idea putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing if it fits. What do I mean? Well, let’s start by recalling a police policy officers and the law enforcement establishment loves, but turned out not to be so popular with the people. I’m talking zero tolerance, a strategy that basically presumes everyone is guilty, and that even the most minor offenses, regardless of circumstance, should bear the full brunt of the law. The idea was rooted in an essay that was published in 1986 by two social sciences, they called it the broken windows theory. It posited that to root out crime in violent neighborhoods, it was important to enforce even the most petty offenses as harshly as possible. The reasoning was the authors argued, that minor crimes were like a building in disrepair, a sign to the community that their neighborhood was not just unlawful but dysfunctional. The theory was that by strenuously enforcing minor crimes you could send a signal to the more violent criminal that their behavior would not be tolerated.

Tens of thousands of people were charged illegally for drinking a beer on a stoop, or walking through a neighborhood where they didn’t live. The number of arrests were so absurd, a new term was coined, known as a walkthrough, which meant that people arrested would simply be walked through a central booking facility without actually being locked up, all because they’d simply arrested too many people to fit them in the facility. Much to the surprise of the politicians and police unions that touted the idea, this policy was not effective. The number of homicides stayed roughly the same, and today are worse now than ever. But the reason I bring this policy up is because maybe it’s time to give the institution that came up with this destructive policy a taste of their own medicine. So what exactly am I saying here?

Why not apply the same stringent laws to yourselves that you apply to us? Of course, I can hear the arguments from the police union now. Cops are only human, everyone makes mistakes.

So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight.

Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved.

I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy? Was he terminated, was he still on paid administrative leave? I also wanted to know if it’s standard practice to offer $4,000 to people who are subject to police abuse. How often does this happen? Is this what they always do? I also wanted to know when the internal investigation would be done, and if they’d be sharing results with the public. Those questions are outstanding, I will follow them, continuing. Taya Graham: Stephen, this is not the first time we’ve reported on the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in a possible case of police abuse. Can you talk a little bit about what we’ve uncovered before? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, let’s remember just a couple of weeks ago we reported on Daniel Alvarez getting harassed by this San Bernardino county sheriff. We have the video right here. He was pulled over for no reason, and then asked if he was on probation or parole, and then the guy pulled out his handcuffs. So, no, this seems to be a problem with them getting in trouble, and questionable arrests and questionable stops. Taya Graham: So, finally, we discussed the death of Anton Black and the fact that officer Thomas Webster, who initiated the stop, was able to get a job despite having an extensive record of citizen complaints. Can you tell us what happened and what we eventually learned? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, what we learned was it’s very easy for a police officer to shift jurisdictions, or go to a different city or town, and suppress their bad record in another place. Basically, the chief of Greensboro just left out all the bad complaints about officer Webster that he accrued in Delaware, and didn’t submit them as part of the application, even though that’s required by law. Webster was certified without any of that information. It turned out that he had to prosecute the chief for doing that, and he ended up pleading guilty to misconduct in office. But the lesson learned is that it’s very easy to subvert the process where officers can be held accountable for past actions. Taya Graham: It seems clear to me that holding this officer accountable for his actions is not just going to be difficult, but perhaps impossible. They actually tried to make an unethical deal with Mr. Jones shortly after the incident occurred, which means the likelihood the agency is going to do a fair and objective investigation certainly remains in doubt. But as the story unfolds, and the department makes excuses for the behavior of the cop in question, I’m reminded of a strategy law enforcement has used against us that might be worth considering as a tactic to ensure that cops don’t avoid consequences for their bad behavior, just like they say we shouldn’t either. Let’s call this idea putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing if it fits. What do I mean? Well, let’s start by recalling a police policy officers and the law enforcement establishment loves, but turned out not to be so popular with the people. I’m talking zero tolerance, a strategy that basically presumes everyone is guilty, and that even the most minor offenses, regardless of circumstance, should bear the full brunt of the law. The idea was rooted in an essay that was published in 1986 by two social sciences, they called it the broken windows theory. It posited that to root out crime in violent neighborhoods, it was important to enforce even the most petty offenses as harshly as possible. The reasoning was the authors argued, that minor crimes were like a building in disrepair, a sign to the community that their neighborhood was not just unlawful but dysfunctional. The theory was that by strenuously enforcing minor crimes you could send a signal to the more violent criminal that their behavior would not be tolerated. This led to the so-called zero tolerance strategy, a policing tactic that meant when you spit on the sidewalk, or drank a beer on your front porch, or urinated in an alley, you’re going to jail. In Baltimore, the strategy had devastating consequences. In a city of 600,000 people, nearly 100,000 people were arrested year in and year out for nearly a decade. Tens of thousands of people were charged illegally for drinking a beer on a stoop, or walking through a neighborhood where they didn’t live. The number of arrests were so absurd, a new term was coined, known as a walkthrough, which meant that people arrested would simply be walked through a central booking facility without actually being locked up, all because they’d simply arrested too many people to fit them in the facility. Much to the surprise of the politicians and police unions that touted the idea, this policy was not effective. The number of homicides stayed roughly the same, and today are worse now than ever. But the reason I bring this policy up is because maybe it’s time to give the institution that came up with this destructive policy a taste of their own medicine. So what exactly am I saying here? Well, how about we have zero tolerance for bad behavior by cops? Instead of paid vacations and promotions when they get into trouble, how about we charge them with the same minor crimes they forced upon us? How about getting suspended immediately without pay when a video like this surfaces? Or better yet, like the rest of us, fired? How about they get a ticket every time they forget to wear a seatbelt, or they get a criminal citation for not mowing their yard? Or how about they get suspended without pay–let me repeat, without pay–as any of us would in the first step of an internal investigation, not the last? Why not apply the same stringent laws to yourselves that you apply to us? Of course, I can hear the arguments from the police union now. Cops are only human, everyone makes mistakes. It’s the intent of the law, not the letter of the law, that matters. You can’t arrest your way out of a problem. Gee, where have I heard that before? An argument that was met with indifference and skepticism by police unions and partisans who urge law and order at all costs when zero tolerance was destroying people’s lives. Where was the call for humanity when the citizens of this country were subject to the strictest of enforcements of criminal law in the history of any nation? Who was asking for leniency when we became the larger incarcerator of human beings in the history of civilization? That’s why I think it might be worthwhile to apply the same standard to them as they do to us. Perhaps the officer pictured in the video should be fired first, and rehired if he’s proved innocent later. Let’s call it zero tolerance for bad police behavior. Why shouldn’t they be treated like us? Perhaps it will teach them a lesson that most of us already know. Enforcing the letter of the law has devastating consequences. Maybe it’s time for law enforcement to understand just how devastating that can be. I’d like to thank my guest, Mr. Zulu Ali, for joining us and explaining the details of this case. Thank you. Of course, I have to thank intrepid reporter Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing for the piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I never get tired of saying, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. Today we’re going to do so by reporting on a disturbing video out of a small town in California, where a deputy sheriff kicked a man prone on the ground and knocked him unconscious. Well, what happened after this assault occurred makes the story even more indicative of the theme of this show, because it’s how the system is handling this case that we will unpack and report on in detail. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. We have a Patreon for donations pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, one of the most troubling patterns in American policing is how often cops are above the laws they enforce, especially when it comes to discipline for bad behavior. A lack of holding officers accountable can often lead to more trouble down the road. What do I mean? Well, consider a case we reported on extensively before. It involved the death of a 19-year-old named Anton Black. Anton was walking with his cousin in September of 2018 in a small town called Greensboro on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore. A Karen called the police and falsely accused him of kidnapping a 12-year-old boy who accompanied him on his walk. It turns out that child was a relative, but that didn’t prevent the Greensboro police officer, Thomas Webster, from accosting Anton, as you can see here in this body camera footage. I have to warn you the video that follows of Anton being confronted, chased, tasered and choked by police is disturbing, so please fast forward through that footage if you don’t wish to see it. Webster chased Anton back to his mother’s home, where the young track star and aspiring model hid in a family car. Officer Webster, for reasons that still remain unknown, decided to escalate the situation by smashing the window, even though Anton did not present a threat, a move that led to this. Minutes later, a 200-pound police officer lying his body across Anton’s, an act which his lawyers say led to his death. But the reason I bring up this case today is due to what was learned after this tragic incident. That’s because as police stonewalled the probe into his death we learned that officer Webster had been involved in another high-profile case of police brutality. As you can see in this dash cam footage, Webster had kicked a man in the jaw, breaking it, during an arrest. The case led to charges of assault of which Webster was found not guilty. But even though Webster was implicated in at least a dozen other cases of brutality in Delaware, he was able to cross state lines and get a job as a cop in Maryland. The reason I bring this case up today is because of the video I’m showing you now. It involves another example of a cop using unnecessary force, and it’s also raising many of the same questions that officer Webster’s track record made clear. Can the system really hold police accountable? That is the question the lawyer for the man seen in this video is asking, after he was knocked unconscious by a San Bernardino county sheriff in May of 2020 during this arrest. As you can see here in the video, Willie Jones was complying with an officer’s order to lay on the ground after a chase that ended in Victorville, California. But for reasons that have yet to be explained, the cop kicked Mr. Jones in the face and head as he lay prone in a parking lot. So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation. In response to the alleged traffic violation, they were allegedly engaged or trying to engage in a traffic stop, and stated that Mr. Jones had avoided or fled their attempts to stop him. But, at any rate, Mr. Jones ended up at a car lot in Victorville, California, which was depicted actually in a videotape or video surveillance that was actually caught, I believe it was a security company that had a video surveillance of this car dealership. While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands. He had laid down on his stomach and spread his arms out and was no threat to the officers, was in compliance. The officer then just walked over to Mr. Jones and kicked him twice in the head and then placed him in handcuffs. Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes. Once he was actually taken to be treated medically, or taken to the emergency room, then he was taken back to a jail facility or a custodial facility. While he was at the custodial facility, within a very short period of time, he was approached by deputies who gave him some documents to actually sign. My understanding is that this is pretty routine for this particular department, being the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. They often do that with–I’ve even heard the situations where they try to get people to sign waivers while they’re still in hospital beds. But, at any rate, they approached him and gave him some documents to sign, trying to see if they would release his claims for $4,000. I do know that there are other cases–obviously those aren’t honored in most cases or in any cases that I know of–but they try to get people to sign. They send the [inaudible] and then whenever they cash the money, I guess they try to say that they entered into some sort of agreement, but yeah, that was what they attempted to do. Taya Graham: As a lawyer, do you think this is ethical? Zulu Ali: Absolutely not. I think that there’s a lot of problems with that. Clearly you’re dealing with someone, first of all, who is in custody. Second of all, someone who has actually been just treated medically, and within minutes of doing it they’re approached by deputy sheriffs. Oftentimes, I think that many of these cases are probably not even without the county’s knowledge. I don’t even know if the county council, or county, or at least many of the superiors, from my understanding, at least would admit that they know that they’re engaged in that type of conduct. But yeah, that’s extremely unethical. Taya Graham: What are the legal steps you’ve taken? For example, have you filed a lawsuit? Zulu Ali: Absolutely. Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved. Or, if it’s not resolved, then we will be filing a lawsuit in court. Taya Graham: What has happened to the officer, and do you think he should be disciplined for his actions? Zulu Ali: Yeah. He actually has been identified. I do believe that–right now, my understanding is he’s still on administrative leave. My understanding is it’s paid administrative leave, and they’re investigating. My understanding is also the district attorney’s office is in the process of determining whether criminal charges are going to be filed against the deputy. At least at this point I don’t believe that the Sheriff’s Department has completed their investigation, or at least publicly advised the results of the investigation being completed, or the disposition of that. We haven’t heard anything yet back from the district attorney’s office. But he definitely should be, I think he should be criminally charged. I think that what we observed was someone who was actually committing a crime, and he should be treated as such. I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy?

When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation.

While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands. He had laid down on his stomach and spread his arms out and was no threat to the officers, was in compliance. The officer then just walked over to Mr. Jones and kicked him twice in the head and then placed him in handcuffs. Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes. Once he was actually taken to be treated medically, or taken to the emergency room, then he was taken back to a jail facility or a custodial facility. While he was at the custodial facility, within a very short period of time, he was approached by deputies who gave him some documents to actually sign. My understanding is that this is pretty routine for this particular department, being the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. They often do that with–I’ve even heard the situations where they try to get people to sign waivers while they’re still in hospital beds. But, at any rate, they approached him and gave him some documents to sign, trying to see if they would release his claims for $4,000. I do know that there are other cases–obviously those aren’t honored in most cases or in any cases that I know of–but they try to get people to sign. They send the [inaudible] and then whenever they cash the money, I guess they try to say that they entered into some sort of agreement, but yeah, that was what they attempted to do. Taya Graham: As a lawyer, do you think this is ethical? Zulu Ali: Absolutely not. I think that there’s a lot of problems with that. Clearly you’re dealing with someone, first of all, who is in custody. Second of all, someone who has actually been just treated medically, and within minutes of doing it they’re approached by deputy sheriffs. Oftentimes, I think that many of these cases are probably not even without the county’s knowledge. I don’t even know if the county council, or county, or at least many of the superiors, from my understanding, at least would admit that they know that they’re engaged in that type of conduct. But yeah, that’s extremely unethical. Taya Graham: What are the legal steps you’ve taken? For example, have you filed a lawsuit? Zulu Ali: Absolutely. Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved. Or, if it’s not resolved, then we will be filing a lawsuit in court. Taya Graham: What has happened to the officer, and do you think he should be disciplined for his actions? Zulu Ali: Yeah. He actually has been identified. I do believe that–right now, my understanding is he’s still on administrative leave. My understanding is it’s paid administrative leave, and they’re investigating. My understanding is also the district attorney’s office is in the process of determining whether criminal charges are going to be filed against the deputy. At least at this point I don’t believe that the Sheriff’s Department has completed their investigation, or at least publicly advised the results of the investigation being completed, or the disposition of that. We haven’t heard anything yet back from the district attorney’s office. But he definitely should be, I think he should be criminally charged. I think that what we observed was someone who was actually committing a crime, and he should be treated as such. I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy? Was he terminated, was he still on paid administrative leave? I also wanted to know if it’s standard practice to offer $4,000 to people who are subject to police abuse. How often does this happen? Is this what they always do? I also wanted to know when the internal investigation would be done, and if they’d be sharing results with the public. Those questions are outstanding, I will follow them, continuing. Taya Graham: Stephen, this is not the first time we’ve reported on the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in a possible case of police abuse. Can you talk a little bit about what we’ve uncovered before? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, let’s remember just a couple of weeks ago we reported on Daniel Alvarez getting harassed by this San Bernardino county sheriff. We have the video right here. He was pulled over for no reason, and then asked if he was on probation or parole, and then the guy pulled out his handcuffs. So, no, this seems to be a problem with them getting in trouble, and questionable arrests and questionable stops. Taya Graham: So, finally, we discussed the death of Anton Black and the fact that officer Thomas Webster, who initiated the stop, was able to get a job despite having an extensive record of citizen complaints. Can you tell us what happened and what we eventually learned? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, what we learned was it’s very easy for a police officer to shift jurisdictions, or go to a different city or town, and suppress their bad record in another place. Basically, the chief of Greensboro just left out all the bad complaints about officer Webster that he accrued in Delaware, and didn’t submit them as part of the application, even though that’s required by law. Webster was certified without any of that information. It turned out that he had to prosecute the chief for doing that, and he ended up pleading guilty to misconduct in office. But the lesson learned is that it’s very easy to subvert the process where officers can be held accountable for past actions. Taya Graham: It seems clear to me that holding this officer accountable for his actions is not just going to be difficult, but perhaps impossible. They actually tried to make an unethical deal with Mr. Jones shortly after the incident occurred, which means the likelihood the agency is going to do a fair and objective investigation certainly remains in doubt. But as the story unfolds, and the department makes excuses for the behavior of the cop in question, I’m reminded of a strategy law enforcement has used against us that might be worth considering as a tactic to ensure that cops don’t avoid consequences for their bad behavior, just like they say we shouldn’t either. Let’s call this idea putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing if it fits. What do I mean? Well, let’s start by recalling a police policy officers and the law enforcement establishment loves, but turned out not to be so popular with the people. I’m talking zero tolerance, a strategy that basically presumes everyone is guilty, and that even the most minor offenses, regardless of circumstance, should bear the full brunt of the law. The idea was rooted in an essay that was published in 1986 by two social sciences, they called it the broken windows theory. It posited that to root out crime in violent neighborhoods, it was important to enforce even the most petty offenses as harshly as possible. The reasoning was the authors argued, that minor crimes were like a building in disrepair, a sign to the community that their neighborhood was not just unlawful but dysfunctional. The theory was that by strenuously enforcing minor crimes you could send a signal to the more violent criminal that their behavior would not be tolerated. This led to the so-called zero tolerance strategy, a policing tactic that meant when you spit on the sidewalk, or drank a beer on your front porch, or urinated in an alley, you’re going to jail. In Baltimore, the strategy had devastating consequences. In a city of 600,000 people, nearly 100,000 people were arrested year in and year out for nearly a decade. Tens of thousands of people were charged illegally for drinking a beer on a stoop, or walking through a neighborhood where they didn’t live. The number of arrests were so absurd, a new term was coined, known as a walkthrough, which meant that people arrested would simply be walked through a central booking facility without actually being locked up, all because they’d simply arrested too many people to fit them in the facility. Much to the surprise of the politicians and police unions that touted the idea, this policy was not effective. The number of homicides stayed roughly the same, and today are worse now than ever. But the reason I bring this policy up is because maybe it’s time to give the institution that came up with this destructive policy a taste of their own medicine. So what exactly am I saying here? Well, how about we have zero tolerance for bad behavior by cops? Instead of paid vacations and promotions when they get into trouble, how about we charge them with the same minor crimes they forced upon us? How about getting suspended immediately without pay when a video like this surfaces? Or better yet, like the rest of us, fired? How about they get a ticket every time they forget to wear a seatbelt, or they get a criminal citation for not mowing their yard? Or how about they get suspended without pay–let me repeat, without pay–as any of us would in the first step of an internal investigation, not the last? Why not apply the same stringent laws to yourselves that you apply to us? Of course, I can hear the arguments from the police union now. Cops are only human, everyone makes mistakes. It’s the intent of the law, not the letter of the law, that matters. You can’t arrest your way out of a problem. Gee, where have I heard that before? An argument that was met with indifference and skepticism by police unions and partisans who urge law and order at all costs when zero tolerance was destroying people’s lives. Where was the call for humanity when the citizens of this country were subject to the strictest of enforcements of criminal law in the history of any nation? Who was asking for leniency when we became the larger incarcerator of human beings in the history of civilization? That’s why I think it might be worthwhile to apply the same standard to them as they do to us. Perhaps the officer pictured in the video should be fired first, and rehired if he’s proved innocent later. Let’s call it zero tolerance for bad police behavior. Why shouldn’t they be treated like us? Perhaps it will teach them a lesson that most of us already know. Enforcing the letter of the law has devastating consequences. Maybe it’s time for law enforcement to understand just how devastating that can be. I’d like to thank my guest, Mr. Zulu Ali, for joining us and explaining the details of this case. Thank you. Of course, I have to thank intrepid reporter Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing for the piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I never get tired of saying, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. Today we’re going to do so by reporting on a disturbing video out of a small town in California, where a deputy sheriff kicked a man prone on the ground and knocked him unconscious. Well, what happened after this assault occurred makes the story even more indicative of the theme of this show, because it’s how the system is handling this case that we will unpack and report on in detail. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. We have a Patreon for donations pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, one of the most troubling patterns in American policing is how often cops are above the laws they enforce, especially when it comes to discipline for bad behavior. A lack of holding officers accountable can often lead to more trouble down the road. What do I mean? Well, consider a case we reported on extensively before. It involved the death of a 19-year-old named Anton Black. Anton was walking with his cousin in September of 2018 in a small town called Greensboro on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore. A Karen called the police and falsely accused him of kidnapping a 12-year-old boy who accompanied him on his walk. It turns out that child was a relative, but that didn’t prevent the Greensboro police officer, Thomas Webster, from accosting Anton, as you can see here in this body camera footage. I have to warn you the video that follows of Anton being confronted, chased, tasered and choked by police is disturbing, so please fast forward through that footage if you don’t wish to see it. Webster chased Anton back to his mother’s home, where the young track star and aspiring model hid in a family car. Officer Webster, for reasons that still remain unknown, decided to escalate the situation by smashing the window, even though Anton did not present a threat, a move that led to this. Minutes later, a 200-pound police officer lying his body across Anton’s, an act which his lawyers say led to his death. But the reason I bring up this case today is due to what was learned after this tragic incident. That’s because as police stonewalled the probe into his death we learned that officer Webster had been involved in another high-profile case of police brutality. As you can see in this dash cam footage, Webster had kicked a man in the jaw, breaking it, during an arrest. The case led to charges of assault of which Webster was found not guilty. But even though Webster was implicated in at least a dozen other cases of brutality in Delaware, he was able to cross state lines and get a job as a cop in Maryland. The reason I bring this case up today is because of the video I’m showing you now. It involves another example of a cop using unnecessary force, and it’s also raising many of the same questions that officer Webster’s track record made clear. Can the system really hold police accountable? That is the question the lawyer for the man seen in this video is asking, after he was knocked unconscious by a San Bernardino county sheriff in May of 2020 during this arrest. As you can see here in the video, Willie Jones was complying with an officer’s order to lay on the ground after a chase that ended in Victorville, California. But for reasons that have yet to be explained, the cop kicked Mr. Jones in the face and head as he lay prone in a parking lot. So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation. In response to the alleged traffic violation, they were allegedly engaged or trying to engage in a traffic stop, and stated that Mr. Jones had avoided or fled their attempts to stop him. But, at any rate, Mr. Jones ended up at a car lot in Victorville, California, which was depicted actually in a videotape or video surveillance that was actually caught, I believe it was a security company that had a video surveillance of this car dealership. While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands.

Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes.

Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved.

But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. We have a Patreon for donations pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve gotten that out of the way. Now, one of the most troubling patterns in American policing is how often cops are above the laws they enforce, especially when it comes to discipline for bad behavior. A lack of holding officers accountable can often lead to more trouble down the road. What do I mean? Well, consider a case we reported on extensively before. It involved the death of a 19-year-old named Anton Black. Anton was walking with his cousin in September of 2018 in a small town called Greensboro on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore. A Karen called the police and falsely accused him of kidnapping a 12-year-old boy who accompanied him on his walk. It turns out that child was a relative, but that didn’t prevent the Greensboro police officer, Thomas Webster, from accosting Anton, as you can see here in this body camera footage. I have to warn you the video that follows of Anton being confronted, chased, tasered and choked by police is disturbing, so please fast forward through that footage if you don’t wish to see it. Webster chased Anton back to his mother’s home, where the young track star and aspiring model hid in a family car. Officer Webster, for reasons that still remain unknown, decided to escalate the situation by smashing the window, even though Anton did not present a threat, a move that led to this. Minutes later, a 200-pound police officer lying his body across Anton’s, an act which his lawyers say led to his death. But the reason I bring up this case today is due to what was learned after this tragic incident. That’s because as police stonewalled the probe into his death we learned that officer Webster had been involved in another high-profile case of police brutality. As you can see in this dash cam footage, Webster had kicked a man in the jaw, breaking it, during an arrest. The case led to charges of assault of which Webster was found not guilty. But even though Webster was implicated in at least a dozen other cases of brutality in Delaware, he was able to cross state lines and get a job as a cop in Maryland. The reason I bring this case up today is because of the video I’m showing you now. It involves another example of a cop using unnecessary force, and it’s also raising many of the same questions that officer Webster’s track record made clear. Can the system really hold police accountable? That is the question the lawyer for the man seen in this video is asking, after he was knocked unconscious by a San Bernardino county sheriff in May of 2020 during this arrest. As you can see here in the video, Willie Jones was complying with an officer’s order to lay on the ground after a chase that ended in Victorville, California. But for reasons that have yet to be explained, the cop kicked Mr. Jones in the face and head as he lay prone in a parking lot. So, to find out more, we contacted Willy Jones’ lawyer, Zulu Ali, to get his take on what happened, and the strange deal that was offered to Mr. Jones after the incident occurred, and why it’s raising questions about the ability of police to police themselves. Mr. Ali, thank you so much for joining us today. Zulu Ali: Thank you very much for having me. Taya Graham: First, tell us about the circumstances that led to the car stop and chase. When did this happen, and where? Zulu Ali: The allegations were, I believe, it was June the 16th, 2021, sometime in the morning or after midnight or close to midnight. There is an allegation that my client, Mr. Willie Jones, had committed some sort of traffic violation. In response to the alleged traffic violation, they were allegedly engaged or trying to engage in a traffic stop, and stated that Mr. Jones had avoided or fled their attempts to stop him. But, at any rate, Mr. Jones ended up at a car lot in Victorville, California, which was depicted actually in a videotape or video surveillance that was actually caught, I believe it was a security company that had a video surveillance of this car dealership. While he’s at this car dealership the officers made contact with Mr. [Jones], and after making contact with Mr. [Jones] they gave him some commands. He was following the commands. He had laid down on his stomach and spread his arms out and was no threat to the officers, was in compliance. The officer then just walked over to Mr. Jones and kicked him twice in the head and then placed him in handcuffs. Mr. Jones advised that at some point in time he was unconscious, and at some point, I think between the time of kicking him the second time and taking him to the patrol vehicle, I believe he remembers some of that, but that’s the long and short of it. We’ve been asked–as of today Mr. Jones was arrested for felony evasion. However, there’s never been any information with regards to why the traffic stop was actually being made or what traffic violation he allegedly was in violation of. Taya Graham: What injuries did he suffer? I have seen injuries from kicks like this damaging the orbital ridge, loss of teeth, fracturing of the jaw. There really can be severe injuries from incidents like this. Zulu Ali: He does have injuries. To the extent that I can give details about the exact medical diagnosis of those injuries at this point, I’m not really at liberty to say, but he did sustain injuries. Taya Graham: Now, according to what we’ve heard from the community, Will was offered a deal not to file a complaint. Can you talk about that? Zulu Ali: Yes. Once he was actually taken to be treated medically, or taken to the emergency room, then he was taken back to a jail facility or a custodial facility. While he was at the custodial facility, within a very short period of time, he was approached by deputies who gave him some documents to actually sign. My understanding is that this is pretty routine for this particular department, being the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. They often do that with–I’ve even heard the situations where they try to get people to sign waivers while they’re still in hospital beds. But, at any rate, they approached him and gave him some documents to sign, trying to see if they would release his claims for $4,000. I do know that there are other cases–obviously those aren’t honored in most cases or in any cases that I know of–but they try to get people to sign. They send the [inaudible] and then whenever they cash the money, I guess they try to say that they entered into some sort of agreement, but yeah, that was what they attempted to do. Taya Graham: As a lawyer, do you think this is ethical? Zulu Ali: Absolutely not. I think that there’s a lot of problems with that. Clearly you’re dealing with someone, first of all, who is in custody. Second of all, someone who has actually been just treated medically, and within minutes of doing it they’re approached by deputy sheriffs. Oftentimes, I think that many of these cases are probably not even without the county’s knowledge. I don’t even know if the county council, or county, or at least many of the superiors, from my understanding, at least would admit that they know that they’re engaged in that type of conduct. But yeah, that’s extremely unethical. Taya Graham: What are the legal steps you’ve taken? For example, have you filed a lawsuit? Zulu Ali: Absolutely. Of course, because of the nature of the lawsuit, it begins with what they call a tort claim, which is an administrative process, which we are in the initial administrative process. Then, once we complete that process–which usually takes anywhere between 45 to 60 days from the date that the claim is filed–then they either accept the claim and it’s resolved. Or, if it’s not resolved, then we will be filing a lawsuit in court. Taya Graham: What has happened to the officer, and do you think he should be disciplined for his actions? Zulu Ali: Yeah. He actually has been identified. I do believe that–right now, my understanding is he’s still on administrative leave. My understanding is it’s paid administrative leave, and they’re investigating. My understanding is also the district attorney’s office is in the process of determining whether criminal charges are going to be filed against the deputy. At least at this point I don’t believe that the Sheriff’s Department has completed their investigation, or at least publicly advised the results of the investigation being completed, or the disposition of that. We haven’t heard anything yet back from the district attorney’s office. But he definitely should be, I think he should be criminally charged. I think that what we observed was someone who was actually committing a crime, and he should be treated as such. I believe that at least what we saw on the video was clearly a criminal offense, and I think that the district attorney’s office should pursue criminal charges against this officer. That was just unbelievable. I know that we see so much of it, and we’ve seen so much of it lately–and when I say lately, I mean, that’s I guess an understatement. It’s been going on for quite some time. We’re just catching it now on video. This conduct and these types of actions by law enforcement officers has to stop. Taya Graham: My reporting partner Stephen Janis has also been reaching out to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Office for comment. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve reached out to San Bernardino County sheriffs for comment. What did they say? Stephen Janis: Well, number one, they didn’t say anything yet, but what I asked was very specific. I wanted to know, number one, what was the employment status of the deputy? Was he terminated, was he still on paid administrative leave? I also wanted to know if it’s standard practice to offer $4,000 to people who are subject to police abuse. How often does this happen? Is this what they always do? I also wanted to know when the internal investigation would be done, and if they’d be sharing results with the public. Those questions are outstanding, I will follow them, continuing. Taya Graham: Stephen, this is not the first time we’ve reported on the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in a possible case of police abuse. Can you talk a little bit about what we’ve uncovered before? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, let’s remember just a couple of weeks ago we reported on Daniel Alvarez getting harassed by this San Bernardino county sheriff. We have the video right here. He was pulled over for no reason, and then asked if he was on probation or parole, and then the guy pulled out his handcuffs. So, no, this seems to be a problem with them getting in trouble, and questionable arrests and questionable stops. Taya Graham: So, finally, we discussed the death of Anton Black and the fact that officer Thomas Webster, who initiated the stop, was able to get a job despite having an extensive record of citizen complaints. Can you tell us what happened and what we eventually learned? Stephen Janis: Well, Taya, what we learned was it’s very easy for a police officer to shift jurisdictions, or go to a different city or town, and suppress their bad record in another place. Basically, the chief of Greensboro just left out all the bad complaints about officer Webster that he accrued in Delaware, and didn’t submit them as part of the application, even though that’s required by law. Webster was certified without any of that information. It turned out that he had to prosecute the chief for doing that, and he ended up pleading guilty to misconduct in office. But the lesson learned is that it’s very easy to subvert the process where officers can be held accountable for past actions. Taya Graham: It seems clear to me that holding this officer accountable for his actions is not just going to be difficult, but perhaps impossible. They actually tried to make an unethical deal with Mr. Jones shortly after the incident occurred, which means the likelihood the agency is going to do a fair and objective investigation certainly remains in doubt. But as the story unfolds, and the department makes excuses for the behavior of the cop in question, I’m reminded of a strategy law enforcement has used against us that might be worth considering as a tactic to ensure that cops don’t avoid consequences for their bad behavior, just like they say we shouldn’t either. Let’s call this idea putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing if it fits. What do I mean? Well, let’s start by recalling a police policy officers and the law enforcement establishment loves, but turned out not to be so popular with the people. I’m talking zero tolerance, a strategy that basically presumes everyone is guilty, and that even the most minor offenses, regardless of circumstance, should bear the full brunt of the law. The idea was rooted in an essay that was published in 1986 by two social sciences, they called it the broken windows theory. It posited that to root out crime in violent neighborhoods, it was important to enforce even the most petty offenses as harshly as possible. The reasoning was the authors argued, that minor crimes were like a building in disrepair, a sign to the community that their neighborhood was not just unlawful but dysfunctional. The theory was that by strenuously enforcing minor crimes you could send a signal to the more violent criminal that their behavior would not be tolerated. This led to the so-called zero tolerance strategy, a policing tactic that meant when you spit on the sidewalk, or drank a beer on your front porch, or urinated in an alley, you’re going to jail. In Baltimore, the strategy had devastating consequences. In a city of 600,000 people, nearly 100,000 people were arrested year in and year out for nearly a decade. Tens of thousands of people were charged illegally for drinking a beer on a stoop, or walking through a neighborhood where they didn’t live. The number of arrests were so absurd, a new term was coined, known as a walkthrough, which meant that people arrested would simply be walked through a central booking facility without actually being locked up, all because they’d simply arrested too many people to fit them in the facility. Much to the surprise of the politicians and police unions that touted the idea, this policy was not effective. The number of homicides stayed roughly the same, and today are worse now than ever. But the reason I bring this policy up is because maybe it’s time to give the institution that came up with this destructive policy a taste of their own medicine. So what exactly am I saying here? Well, how about we have zero tolerance for bad behavior by cops? Instead of paid vacations and promotions when they get into trouble, how about we charge them with the same minor crimes they forced upon us? How about getting suspended immediately without pay when a video like this surfaces? Or better yet, like the rest of us, fired? How about they get a ticket every time they forget to wear a seatbelt, or they get a criminal citation for not mowing their yard? Or how about they get suspended without pay–let me repeat, without pay–as any of us would in the first step of an internal investigation, not the last? Why not apply the same stringent laws to yourselves that you apply to us? Of course, I can hear the arguments from the police union now. Cops are only human, everyone makes mistakes. It’s the intent of the law, not the letter of the law, that matters. You can’t arrest your way out of a problem. Gee, where have I heard that before? An argument that was met with indifference and skepticism by police unions and partisans who urge law and order at all costs when zero tolerance was destroying people’s lives. Where was the call for humanity when the citizens of this country were subject to the strictest of enforcements of criminal law in the history of any nation? Who was asking for leniency when we became the larger incarcerator of human beings in the history of civilization? That’s why I think it might be worthwhile to apply the same standard to them as they do to us. Perhaps the officer pictured in the video should be fired first, and rehired if he’s proved innocent later. Let’s call it zero tolerance for bad police behavior. Why shouldn’t they be treated like us? Perhaps it will teach them a lesson that most of us already know. Enforcing the letter of the law has devastating consequences. Maybe it’s time for law enforcement to understand just how devastating that can be. I’d like to thank my guest, Mr. Zulu Ali, for joining us and explaining the details of this case. Thank you. Of course, I have to thank intrepid reporter Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing for the piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Of course, I want to thank friend of the show Noli Dee for her support. Thanks, Noli Dee.

We have a few goodies for our patrons. My name is Taya Graham, and I am your host of the Police Accountability Report. Please be safe out there. The brutal assault on a suspect after a high-speed chase that was captured by a security camera reveals how police have many hidden mechanisms to skirt accountability. In this episode, PAR examines not just the circumstances surrounding the attack on a man who was complying with police orders, but how law enforcement used questionable tactics to limit their own liability for what happened. \n",

Along with the photos—which showed a child flanked by smiling police while holding a “Baltimore Ceasefire” sign, and Ceasefire co-founder Erricka Bridgeford receiving a hug from Police Commissioner Michael Harrison—the tweet posted on Saturday, Aug. 7, read: “Celebrating @BmoreCeasefire weekend with our community! #Unity #CommunityPolicing #MyBmore,”  A little more than a day after celebrating Baltimore Ceasefire and boasting of its dedication to “community policing,” the BPD shot and killed someone.  His name was Marcus Martin, he was 40 years old, and at around 3:00AM on Monday, Aug. 9, Officer Jeffery Archambault of SWAT shot him. A cousin of Martin’s widow took to Twitter to ask why it happened the way it did. “I’m still at loss as to why @BaltimorePolice responded with a swat team. A mental health crisis is a mental health crisis regardless of whether the individual has a weapon or not,” the cousin of Martin’s widow tweeted. According to police, BPD were called to the home around 9:00PM on Sunday because of an assault. There were people inside the home along with Martin, and they told police Martin had assaulted them and that he was armed. When police arrived, they were able to leave the home which left Martin alone with a shotgun, his house surrounded by cops. Days earlier, Martin had lost his job.  The initial call to police was for an assault, and therefore it was not diverted to mental health professionals. BPD’s own “crisis response team” was also not present because it only operates between the hours of 11:00AM and 7:00PM.  \n",

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. Today, we’re going to talk about the 13th Amendment and the effort in California to remove the slavery portion of debt. So joining me today is two organizers and activists who has been working in California to change that, John Cannon and Jeronimo Aguilar. Thanks for joining me, John and Jeronimo. Jeronimo Aguilar: Thank you. It’s an honor to be here. John Cannon: Thank you to have us here. It’s an honor to have [inaudible]. Eddie Conway: So let’s start off, Jeronimo, let’s start off with you. Talk a little bit about your work, your past history, and where we are today. And then I’ll go to John in a minute. Jeronimo Aguilar: Yes, sir. So I’m a Chicano from Northern California. I grew up in the Bay Area. My parents were both social workers. And so I grew up around people kind of cycling through the criminal justice system, trying to get the lives straight. And so I also have a lot of family that was involved in activism and the Chicano movement and the civil rights movement in the ’60s and ’70s. And so, with that education, I was always taught about my rights and, kind of, our role in making sure that we’re always reaching towards liberation. And so, growing up, I moved out here, actually, into the rural Yolo County, which is a rural area here in Northern California in the middle of, kind of, Sacramento and the Bay Area. And so I got involved once I started going to school and getting myself educated after various run-ins with the law here in the rural area, the cops are–everybody knows each other. And so for good and for bad, the police definitely have their eyes on you. And so was definitely profiled and followed, me and my brothers. And so after catching cases as a juvenile for various things and defending myself even against a lot of, kind of, rural racism that goes on out here, I decided to educate myself and go to school. Majored in Chicano studies at Sacramento State and got involved with the Brown Berets. And so as a Brown Beret activist, I started a chapter at Sacramento State and got involved in a statewide coalition. And after that, again, the law enforcement in Sacramento had their eyes on me. I was involved in some high-profile kind of events or movements. I was able to spend time out of Standing Rock when they were fighting the pipeline out there, and various other movements. And just with that surveillance, again, I had cops following me, come into my house, and those types of things. And so it was right around that time that for the sake of my children–I’ve got two little ones–I decided to get involved with All of Us or None Legal Services for Prisoners with Children. They had a policy fellowship actually opening, the Elder Freeman Policy Fellowship. Elder Freeman is a Black Panther. And so I thought, wow, as a Brown Beret–and I was currently fighting the case against the Sacramento police department. And so none of these nonprofits would really look to hire me because of, kind of, my record and also my involvement with what they call ‘radical activism.’ But Dorsey Nuun over at LSPC was very gracious, and he gave me the opportunity to learn the policy side of things, to be able to learn how bills get made into law, and really just a rigorous fellowship learning how things go down at the Capitol and how we can educate our community on the grassroots level. And so I’ve been here with LSPC since about February. And so it’s been a great experience getting to know the staff. I’ve known about the organization for many years. And All of Us or None also as, kind of, our community organizing arm, where we’re able to just be in the community and talk with folks, and educate, and learn from people, as well. And so it’s been a great experience, has been a blessing and- Eddie Conway: Jeronimo, let’s stop right there. Let’s stop right there. That’s good, because that gives us some background. John, talk a little bit about yourself. You’ve been inside. How have that impacted your sisters, your brothers, your family, et cetera? Talk a little bit about yourself for minute there. John Cannon: So I also grew up in Northern California. I grew up in the Bay Area, Richmond, and Oakland area. Live in Oakland now. Even being young, I was impacted by the prison-industrial complex, by the system. My mom was incarcerated most of my life until she passed. My father was incarcerated. Both my older brothers and I–Iwas 16 years old when I caught a case. And they certified me as an adult, sent me to prison at 16. So I was a sophomore in high school. It’s affected my life a lot. So I know the ins and outs of the system. And I wasn’t really hip to a lot of things until I went to prison and got under some older fellows that taught me things. They put me up on some books. So once I started seeing the injustices and how bigger the issue was, it lit a fire inside of me. So right now, I’m a student of it and I’m just trying to make a change however I can, just like Jeronimo. I was released from prison in November last year. And I got the opportunity to become a Elder Freeman Policy Fellow, met Dorsey Nuun. It’s a big thing for him to enable us to speak in our own voices. We’re doing work for people that are incarcerated, formerly incarcerated. And that’s one of the big things he says, man, you have a space here. This is your space. You need to speak in your own voice. So at first I was a little nervous because I’m not too educated school-wise, but I was educated in prison. Eddie Conway: OK. Yeah, yeah. Let’s stop right there, because education comes in all different kinds of forms. Jeronimo, talk for a minute about the 13th Amendment. We know kind of what it means. Why are you challenging it? Why is this happening in California? Jeronimo Aguilar:  Yes, sir. So I think that a big part of it is that what we’re taught in school is that slavery was ended. Emancipation happened and slavery was a thing of the past. And to the effect that they even say forget about it and move on, slavery was done away with. So as somebody with Indigenous heritage, somebody that understands the weight of slavery, especially here in California with Indigenous people, it’s something that hits home for me. And so knowing that exception exists, the exception that slavery is prohibited except for a punishment of a crime, and knowing that I got so many family and friends and people still in there being worked for $8, or $4, or you name it–just very inhumane wages–that really, again, also like John, it lit a fire under me to really get involved with the efforts in California to amend our constitution. Eddie Conway: OK. John, just from inside, how was it? I mean, obviously you grew into an adult. They put you in an adult prison, obviously. How was that for you as a juvenile? And like you said, having family members incarcerated, and not really having outside support, how was it for you inside? John Cannon: It was pretty crazy, especially being so young. I was the youngest person on the yard. And then, even in terms as the 13th Amendment, how the involuntary servitude was, you feel it firsthand. The first thing we did when we got off the bus, they take us off shackles. They strip you naked in front of everybody. And right after that, they sent us to a room and give us a job. And at the time, too, I was kind of excited about a job, because I didn’t have any money. Nobody was sending me money. So I just remember feeling like it was an auction block. They got you naked then they put you on a job. And there was an OG that told me, I’m like, man, I’m about to get paid. He’s like, you don’t get paid for working in here. I’m like, what? You about to be slaving on that yard labor crew. They put me on yard labor. So me, I was young. I’m like, well, if I’m not getting paid, I’m not working. And he was like, man, don’t work like that. He’s like, you a number now, you belong to the state. So I seen it. If you don’t work in there, it’s all type of consequences. So you’re forced into it, and you don’t get paid at all. And I did all types of jobs, from yard labor, to kitchen work, to warehouse work. And then eventually I was let on a fire crew, which is really dangerous work, and hard work. And you working with firefighters that’s from the outside, and they getting paid more in an hour than you get paid in a whole month. So it’s like–really degrading. You just feel the effects of it. And just even being in prison at that young age, it’s just, it was pretty crazy. Eddie Conway: Okay. And I guess I’m throwing this back to you, Jeronimo. What made you think … you all. Anytime I say ‘you’ I’m talking about All of Us or None, and I’m talking about the movement itself. What made you think that in the California Capitol they could, or would, do anything about removing that particular clause? Apparently–and this is something I just learned from looking at the research–apparently the California state has a set of laws and regulations to make them in compliance with the United States Constitution about this 13th Amendment, and so on. What made you think y’all could change that in California? And I guess, in addition to that, is, where is that now?  Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. I think for us, I mean, it’s really the inspiration of folks like you, Eddie, and people that stood against the system, you know what I mean? Our predecessors. And so it only felt right for us to continue the work and the legacy to really end slavery, knowing that it’s not ended, and California being a really influential state. We’ve got the fifth largest economy, and we have some of the most people incarcerated, 70% of those being Black and Brown. And so when you look at the history in California of Indigenous slavery and African-American slavery, it’s the same type of dynamic going on today, inside the prison-industrial complex. And so that’s why, I mean, I think that we didn’t even really think about how tough it was, it was more, this is something that needs to be done. And where it’s at now, is–so we introduced resolutions locally, and our resolutions weren’t really tied to any legislation yet, because there wasn’t any legislation on the state level. There is now. There’s ACA-3, Assembly Constitutional Amendment 3, which is in the California legislature. And it’s been brought about, and Sydney Kamlager is the author of that bill. She’s the elected assemblywoman, I believe, going to be in the Senate now. And so that bill is in appropriations committee. It moved forward through public safety. It did pass, but it got stuck in the suspense file in the appropriations committee, which means that it got flagged as being too costly. And so we knew off the bat that CDCR and the system was going to oppose the bill for sure. And we knew that they were going to say it was going to cost too much to pay people a humane wage. And so we’re really not trying to get into the whole debate about the wages. It’s more about what’s right and what’s wrong. It’s about being humane, and people should be treated as human. Whether they made a mistake, whether they’re inside of a prison or ICE detention facility, because this is also happening in the ICE detention facilities. We know that the system is using this as a way to exploit and to gain free labor, like they did upon colonization, really. And so we have to interrupt that dynamic for the sake of our children and for the future generations. Eddie Conway: OK. John, talk a little bit about what you are doing now on the ground to kind of help this effort. John Cannon: So now, as a policy fellow, I’ve been learning the ins and outs of policy and how to track a bill, how to support a bill. We’ve been doing organizing and just getting the issue raised in our communities, because we got to educate our communities just like we were educated. So we’re just raising the issue. And we got the ABC campaign, which is Abolish Bondage Collectively. And also we have the local resolutions that were getting passed. We have, it’s called ‘Rejects Slavery.’ So whatever city we’re in, Oakland rejects slavery, Sacramento rejects slavery. So Jeronimo has been a big help in this fight. And I’m also learning a lot from him as my brother. So it’s a pretty cool situation that I’m in. It’s a dream come true. I really am able to really just put my foot on the ground and get involved with people I grew up with and everything. Eddie Conway: OK. You said the resolutions in different cities–I understand y’all are having a drive in Oakland. You want to talk a little bit about that, Jeronimo? What’s happening in Oakland in terms of that resolution, and stuff? Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. Well, preface it, like John said, we introduced resolutions all over the state of California in order to just build momentum on the grassroots level. We introduced one in Riverside, San Diego; we were able to pass one in San Francisco unanimously, and they did a press conference and such to support those efforts. And so we moved on from San Francisco, and said, we need to go to Oakland now. And Oakland being a cornerstone of the movement, really, as far as the start of the Black Panthers and just so much of the Civil Rights movement, but we thought that it would be just a good experience for us to raise Oakland as that kind of hub of organizing. And so on Aug. 21, we’re going to be honoring Black August and the organizing of the legendary George Jackson. And we’re also going to be lifting up our resolution, Oakland Rejects Slavery, which is in support of ACA-3 and is in support of denouncing structural racism and vestiges of slavery. And so we’re trying to really build a collective of abolitionists. People that believe that the system needs to be changed and not just reformed, that we need to radically change this thing and rebuild it in a way that’s more humane, that actually serves the interests of the people. And California being so diverse, and Oakland itself being real diverse of Black and Latinos and our AAPI community, I feel it’s the perfect location. And so we’re going to be at Lil Bobby Hutton Park on Aug.21st, I believe from 12 till 4:30. And we’re going to be barbecuing, we’re going to be having some entertainment. We’re going to be having some speakers up there talking about the movement and different things that they’re involved in on the grassroots level. And we’re just going to be coming together as a community and letting the Oakland community know that there’s an organization out here that they could tap in with that is trying to end slavery once and for all. And not only end slavery, but abolish the system as it is. And so I think people are getting energized by that. We’re also going to break bread with people and just spend time with our community as we should. And so with COVID and everything else, it’s been a long time coming since people have been able to get together. I think we’re all really looking forward to the 21st, and honoring the Attica uprising, and just so many things that folks sacrificed behind the wall and honoring all of that history on Aug. 21. And so, yeah, if you follow our page legalservicesforprisonerswithchildren.org, you’ll be able to see kind of the flyer in different ways. If you’re in the area, you’ll be able to come through and spend some time with us, if you’re in California. And if you’re not, there’s other ways that you can impact the community. We’re always accepting donations, or just however you want to get involved. Just tap in with us on our website, or you could always reach out to me or John or any of us, other organizers on the ground. Eddie Conway: OK. John, you say you got out in November, and you hit the ground, and you actually were lucky because you plugged into some positive people and you got, obviously, a great mentor. What’s happening inside … when you came in contact with the older brothers or mentors inside, and they shoved some books in your face and told you to learn. And obviously you’re in great shape, so they took you to the weight room. So what’s happening inside now? Is there a movement of some sort inside that you are in contact with that can help this effort that you are involved in, now, in terms of their outside family members plugging in? Can you talk a little bit about that? What did you leave behind? And if nothing, then what should be done? John Cannon: So when I left, I left a lot of good comrades in there, and I’m still in contact with a bunch of the fellows and also getting them to join All of Us or None. We have an All of Us or None inside membership, also. We’re not just outside, so we keep them up to date. We have a newsletter, we keep them up to date. We answer letters. But also, personally, I have–my brothers are in there. So they’re joining a movement, too, spreading the word and trying to spread the knowledge. And it’s a big movement. A lot of my friends still in there, a lot of good people, a lot of good men in there. A lot of good women in there, too. Eddie Conway: OK. Jeronimo, just bounce for a minute and talk about this movement center that y’all just purchased and developing. Talk about that a little bit. I’m impressed with that. Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. Well, upon getting the fellowship, I headed to the headquarters in Oakland, and it’s called the Freedom and Movement Center. It’s on 4400 Market Street in Oakland. And I was blown away, honestly. When you go in, you see a big banner that says ‘welcome home,’ because Dorsey Nuun, our executive director, prides himself on welcoming people home that are inside for a lot of years. And especially a lot of our elders. A lot of people that have been in there for decades. And so we create a space that it’s all about community. It’s all about welcoming folks after a lot of traumatic years, whether in the system or incarcerated. And so there we have what’s called the ancestor wall where we, basically, we have pictures of just tons of different activists and leaders over the years. It’s just–it’s really a sight to see. And so the Freedom and Movement Center is somewhere where I know that I have felt at home from day one. It’s somewhere that you can be yourself. Like John said, we’re encouraged to speak on our own voice. And a lot of times it’s a lot of pain. It’s a lot of pain that we go through. And so having a space where we can vent and we can talk with each other and we could really be family and community, it’s integral to the movement. We really need those types of spaces. So it kind of reminds me of when I used to read about the Panthers and the Berets, and they would have community centers where folks would come together. It’s really a throwback in that sense. Somewhere where we can all break bread and communion and really just love on each other and support each other, and also strategize on how we can make things better in our community. And so anybody that’s ever in California, I would say, man, make sure you make a trip out to 4400 Market Street to the Freedom and Movement Center, pay a visit to us. We’re going to welcome you with some love, with some food, and just talk community, talk movement with you. And so it’s been a great experience. I think it’s in a great location, being the roots in Oakland. The roots run really deep. And so that movement center is somewhere where people can really dig them roots in, you know what I mean, and get planted. And so the Freedom and Movement Center is a big part of the work that we do. Eddie Conway: OK. Final words, John. If you had an opportunity to just speak to the public and let them know what that experience does to people, juveniles, adults, men and women, when you throw them in cages, that–what would you say that they should take away from that experience? John Cannon: I will say that it’s not humane. It’s really traumatizing. It’s really not human. It closes you in and it forces you to be a certain way, because you’re locked in there like animals. So it kind of forces you to act like that. And then people will judge you based off of the circumstance or based off of where you’ve been, but it’s not a humane thing to do. It’s not it. Eddie Conway: OK. Got you. That’s loud and clear. Jeronimo, you get the final word here. If you want to just speak to the public about your work or what they need to be doing, or why they should be doing something, what would you say? Jeronimo Aguilar: We got 30 All of Us or None chapters in 16 states, and we’re starting to mobilize on the federal level. I would say whatever state that you’re in, whatever area you’re in, either look up All of Us or None–it don’t have to be us. Look up community orgs that are out there trying to liberate, trying to organize and agitate the system. Get involved. I think that so many of us can sit on the sidelines and just be on social media, these other things, and not really get active. And so I would say get active. Join ABC, Abolish Bondage Collectively, that’s a good way for you to get involved in the abolitionist network that we’re creating. And really, it’s not like you’re joining and we’re going to be telling you, all right, here’s the marching order. You’re going to have a chance to really jump in and get involved and help create, because that’s really what we’re all about–learning from each other, building community, and educating each other. And so that’s what I would say is, people get involved, look up Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, All of Us or None. Like I said, we got chapters all over the nation. And let’s make sure that we right these wrongs of the past, and that we abolish slavery once and for all. And once we abolish slavery–and I just want to mention that we amend this part of the Constitution, and that’s not the end of the fight. Colorado, Utah, Nebraska, they’ve already done that. But that’s just the beginning. Because it’s not like the system is going to all of a sudden be paying people $20 an hour to do work. They’re going to struggle against us as well. And so after that is going to be the real fight, and making sure that our people inside are organized. That we’re going on strikes, or we’re unionizing, we’re doing what we need to do in order to make sure that we’re maximizing and capitalizing off that legal right that we have once it’s out of the Constitution. And so I want to emphasize that this is barely the beginning. Once we amend this Constitution on the state level in California, we’ll amend it federally. And once we do that, it’s going to take a big, large organizing effort of our folks to make sure that the system is being held accountable and that people are being treated humanely and being paid a living wage, because that’s only going to help reduce recidivism. It’s only going to uplift our communities. We understand that our mothers and our families take a lot of the toll when we’re inside. Economically, they’re supporting us. They’re charging us for everything. You just had somebody on here about the phone calls, right? There’s companies out here that are capitalizing off of every single aspect, whether it’s food, a phone call, a visit. And so we want to make sure that we’re struggling against that and that we’re making sure that our next generation don’t have to deal with slavery on any level. Eddie Conway: I said this was the final word, but you said something that made me want to ask you one more question. You said the constitution were amended in Colorado and a couple other states. Are you saying that second Amendment piece was taken–Talk about that for a minute, because I wasn’t aware of that. How many states, and what does it mean? Jeronimo Aguilar: So, Utah, Nebraska, and Colorado, to my knowledge–I might be missing one–but there’s a few states that have, through organizing efforts that we’re trying to do, were able to amend their state constitution to remove the exception clause. And so what that did is that gave people inside, as soon as they continue to be exploited, they were able to have legal rights. So whether that’s litigation or lawsuits in order to sue the state and say, hey, hold up, you guys can’t pay us pennies on the dollar anymore, that is removed. And so we have legal bounds now to fight for our rights. And so that’s basically what’s been happening. In Colorado, there’s a lot of lawsuits going down with the inmates, as far as folks fighting for their rights, fighting for the right to be paid some kind of wage. And so we want to make sure that we’re pushing that line here in California as well. Article 1 Section 6 is where that exception lies. And so we want to make sure once we amend that that people inside know their rights. Because a lot of them are just going to continue to work, continue to be pushed into these systems, not knowing any better. And so we–it’s on us to make sure that our folks inside are educated, and understand that, hold on, now, the constitution removed the exception. So now you have the right to demand a fair wage. And so that’s going to take a whole other phase of organizing and educating. So we’re just excited to be part of this entire process. And California, man, it’s really–it’s a huge, like I said earlier, it’s a influential state in the nation. So I really, really strongly feel that if we’re able to amend the constitution here, it’s going to have large repercussions across the nation. And so the amount of money that’s made off of exploited labor here in California is exponential. And so once we attack that part of the prison-industrial complex, that’s going to be a cornerstone that falls. And hopefully we continue to just rip away at the system and rebuild it, like I said earlier, and rebuild it in a more humane way, in a way that all of us are treated humanely. And we talk about love and restoration and redemption instead of just punitive laws that keep us in cells, keep us in cages. Eddie Conway: OK. That was the last word. John, Jeronimo, thanks for joining me. Jeronimo Aguilar: It’s an honor, Mr. Conway. And like I said earlier, it’s an honor to be with you. Eddie Conway: OK. All right. And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. The 13th Amendment outlaws slavery except as punishment for a crime. That means that Black and Brown people in prisons all over the country are forced to work for low or no wages, while others profit. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway speaks with California organizers Jeronimo Aguilar and John Cannon about why we must fight to eradicate the last vestiges of slavery and how they are using legislation and other methods to get the job done. Jeronimo Aguilar is an Elder Freeman Policy Fellow at Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, where he is working on local and statewide legislative efforts including the Vision Act and Oakland Rejects Slavery. John Cannon is a Policy Fellow at Legal Services for Prisoners with Children and an organizer with All of Us or None, a grassroots civil and human rights organization fighting for the rights of formerly-and currently-incarcerated people and our families. \n",

I grew up in the Bay Area. My parents were both social workers. And so I grew up around people kind of cycling through the criminal justice system, trying to get the lives straight. And so I also have a lot of family that was involved in activism and the Chicano movement and the civil rights movement in the ’60s and ’70s. And so, with that education, I was always taught about my rights and, kind of, our role in making sure that we’re always reaching towards liberation. And so, growing up, I moved out here, actually, into the rural Yolo County, which is a rural area here in Northern California in the middle of, kind of, Sacramento and the Bay Area. And so I got involved once I started going to school and getting myself educated after various run-ins with the law here in the rural area, the cops are–everybody knows each other. And so for good and for bad, the police definitely have their eyes on you. And so was definitely profiled and followed, me and my brothers. And so after catching cases as a juvenile for various things and defending myself even against a lot of, kind of, rural racism that goes on out here, I decided to educate myself and go to school. Majored in Chicano studies at Sacramento State and got involved with the Brown Berets. And so as a Brown Beret activist, I started a chapter at Sacramento State and got involved in a statewide coalition. And after that, again, the law enforcement in Sacramento had their eyes on me. I was involved in some high-profile kind of events or movements. I was able to spend time out of Standing Rock when they were fighting the pipeline out there, and various other movements. And just with that surveillance, again, I had cops following me, come into my house, and those types of things. And so it was right around that time that for the sake of my children–I’ve got two little ones–I decided to get involved with All of Us or None Legal Services for Prisoners with Children. They had a policy fellowship actually opening, the Elder Freeman Policy Fellowship. Elder Freeman is a Black Panther. And so I thought, wow, as a Brown Beret–and I was currently fighting the case against the Sacramento police department. And so none of these nonprofits would really look to hire me because of, kind of, my record and also my involvement with what they call ‘radical activism.’ But Dorsey Nuun over at LSPC was very gracious, and he gave me the opportunity to learn the policy side of things, to be able to learn how bills get made into law, and really just a rigorous fellowship learning how things go down at the Capitol and how we can educate our community on the grassroots level. And so I’ve been here with LSPC since about February. And so it’s been a great experience getting to know the staff. I’ve known about the organization for many years. And All of Us or None also as, kind of, our community organizing arm, where we’re able to just be in the community and talk with folks, and educate, and learn from people, as well. And so it’s been a great experience, has been a blessing and- Eddie Conway: Jeronimo, let’s stop right there. Let’s stop right there. That’s good, because that gives us some background. John, talk a little bit about yourself. You’ve been inside. How have that impacted your sisters, your brothers, your family, et cetera? Talk a little bit about yourself for minute there. John Cannon: So I also grew up in Northern California. I grew up in the Bay Area, Richmond, and Oakland area. Live in Oakland now. Even being young, I was impacted by the prison-industrial complex, by the system. My mom was incarcerated most of my life until she passed. My father was incarcerated. Both my older brothers and I–Iwas 16 years old when I caught a case. And they certified me as an adult, sent me to prison at 16. So I was a sophomore in high school. It’s affected my life a lot. So I know the ins and outs of the system. And I wasn’t really hip to a lot of things until I went to prison and got under some older fellows that taught me things. They put me up on some books. So once I started seeing the injustices and how bigger the issue was, it lit a fire inside of me. So right now, I’m a student of it and I’m just trying to make a change however I can, just like Jeronimo. I was released from prison in November last year. And I got the opportunity to become a Elder Freeman Policy Fellow, met Dorsey Nuun. It’s a big thing for him to enable us to speak in our own voices. We’re doing work for people that are incarcerated, formerly incarcerated. And that’s one of the big things he says, man, you have a space here. This is your space. You need to speak in your own voice. So at first I was a little nervous because I’m not too educated school-wise, but I was educated in prison. Eddie Conway: OK. Yeah, yeah. Let’s stop right there, because education comes in all different kinds of forms. Jeronimo, talk for a minute about the 13th Amendment. We know kind of what it means. Why are you challenging it? Why is this happening in California? Jeronimo Aguilar:  Yes, sir. So I think that a big part of it is that what we’re taught in school is that slavery was ended. Emancipation happened and slavery was a thing of the past. And to the effect that they even say forget about it and move on, slavery was done away with. So as somebody with Indigenous heritage, somebody that understands the weight of slavery, especially here in California with Indigenous people, it’s something that hits home for me. And so knowing that exception exists, the exception that slavery is prohibited except for a punishment of a crime, and knowing that I got so many family and friends and people still in there being worked for $8, or $4, or you name it–just very inhumane wages–that really, again, also like John, it lit a fire under me to really get involved with the efforts in California to amend our constitution. Eddie Conway: OK. John, just from inside, how was it? I mean, obviously you grew into an adult. They put you in an adult prison, obviously. How was that for you as a juvenile? And like you said, having family members incarcerated, and not really having outside support, how was it for you inside? John Cannon: It was pretty crazy, especially being so young. I was the youngest person on the yard. And then, even in terms as the 13th Amendment, how the involuntary servitude was, you feel it firsthand. The first thing we did when we got off the bus, they take us off shackles. They strip you naked in front of everybody. And right after that, they sent us to a room and give us a job. And at the time, too, I was kind of excited about a job, because I didn’t have any money. Nobody was sending me money. So I just remember feeling like it was an auction block. They got you naked then they put you on a job. And there was an OG that told me, I’m like, man, I’m about to get paid. He’s like, you don’t get paid for working in here. I’m like, what? You about to be slaving on that yard labor crew. They put me on yard labor. So me, I was young. I’m like, well, if I’m not getting paid, I’m not working. And he was like, man, don’t work like that. He’s like, you a number now, you belong to the state. So I seen it. If you don’t work in there, it’s all type of consequences. So you’re forced into it, and you don’t get paid at all. And I did all types of jobs, from yard labor, to kitchen work, to warehouse work. And then eventually I was let on a fire crew, which is really dangerous work, and hard work. And you working with firefighters that’s from the outside, and they getting paid more in an hour than you get paid in a whole month. So it’s like–really degrading. You just feel the effects of it. And just even being in prison at that young age, it’s just, it was pretty crazy. Eddie Conway: Okay. And I guess I’m throwing this back to you, Jeronimo. What made you think … you all. Anytime I say ‘you’ I’m talking about All of Us or None, and I’m talking about the movement itself. What made you think that in the California Capitol they could, or would, do anything about removing that particular clause? Apparently–and this is something I just learned from looking at the research–apparently the California state has a set of laws and regulations to make them in compliance with the United States Constitution about this 13th Amendment, and so on. What made you think y’all could change that in California? And I guess, in addition to that, is, where is that now?  Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. I think for us, I mean, it’s really the inspiration of folks like you, Eddie, and people that stood against the system, you know what I mean? Our predecessors. And so it only felt right for us to continue the work and the legacy to really end slavery, knowing that it’s not ended, and California being a really influential state. We’ve got the fifth largest economy, and we have some of the most people incarcerated, 70% of those being Black and Brown. And so when you look at the history in California of Indigenous slavery and African-American slavery, it’s the same type of dynamic going on today, inside the prison-industrial complex. And so that’s why, I mean, I think that we didn’t even really think about how tough it was, it was more, this is something that needs to be done. And where it’s at now, is–so we introduced resolutions locally, and our resolutions weren’t really tied to any legislation yet, because there wasn’t any legislation on the state level. There is now. There’s ACA-3, Assembly Constitutional Amendment 3, which is in the California legislature. And it’s been brought about, and Sydney Kamlager is the author of that bill. She’s the elected assemblywoman, I believe, going to be in the Senate now. And so that bill is in appropriations committee. It moved forward through public safety. It did pass, but it got stuck in the suspense file in the appropriations committee, which means that it got flagged as being too costly. And so we knew off the bat that CDCR and the system was going to oppose the bill for sure. And we knew that they were going to say it was going to cost too much to pay people a humane wage. And so we’re really not trying to get into the whole debate about the wages. It’s more about what’s right and what’s wrong. It’s about being humane, and people should be treated as human. Whether they made a mistake, whether they’re inside of a prison or ICE detention facility, because this is also happening in the ICE detention facilities. We know that the system is using this as a way to exploit and to gain free labor, like they did upon colonization, really. And so we have to interrupt that dynamic for the sake of our children and for the future generations. Eddie Conway: OK. John, talk a little bit about what you are doing now on the ground to kind of help this effort. John Cannon: So now, as a policy fellow, I’ve been learning the ins and outs of policy and how to track a bill, how to support a bill. We’ve been doing organizing and just getting the issue raised in our communities, because we got to educate our communities just like we were educated. So we’re just raising the issue. And we got the ABC campaign, which is Abolish Bondage Collectively. And also we have the local resolutions that were getting passed. We have, it’s called ‘Rejects Slavery.’ So whatever city we’re in, Oakland rejects slavery, Sacramento rejects slavery. So Jeronimo has been a big help in this fight. And I’m also learning a lot from him as my brother. So it’s a pretty cool situation that I’m in. It’s a dream come true. I really am able to really just put my foot on the ground and get involved with people I grew up with and everything. Eddie Conway: OK. You said the resolutions in different cities–I understand y’all are having a drive in Oakland. You want to talk a little bit about that, Jeronimo? What’s happening in Oakland in terms of that resolution, and stuff? Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. Well, preface it, like John said, we introduced resolutions all over the state of California in order to just build momentum on the grassroots level. We introduced one in Riverside, San Diego; we were able to pass one in San Francisco unanimously, and they did a press conference and such to support those efforts. And so we moved on from San Francisco, and said, we need to go to Oakland now. And Oakland being a cornerstone of the movement, really, as far as the start of the Black Panthers and just so much of the Civil Rights movement, but we thought that it would be just a good experience for us to raise Oakland as that kind of hub of organizing. And so on Aug. 21, we’re going to be honoring Black August and the organizing of the legendary George Jackson. And we’re also going to be lifting up our resolution, Oakland Rejects Slavery, which is in support of ACA-3 and is in support of denouncing structural racism and vestiges of slavery. And so we’re trying to really build a collective of abolitionists. People that believe that the system needs to be changed and not just reformed, that we need to radically change this thing and rebuild it in a way that’s more humane, that actually serves the interests of the people. And California being so diverse, and Oakland itself being real diverse of Black and Latinos and our AAPI community, I feel it’s the perfect location. And so we’re going to be at Lil Bobby Hutton Park on Aug.21st, I believe from 12 till 4:30. And we’re going to be barbecuing, we’re going to be having some entertainment. We’re going to be having some speakers up there talking about the movement and different things that they’re involved in on the grassroots level. And we’re just going to be coming together as a community and letting the Oakland community know that there’s an organization out here that they could tap in with that is trying to end slavery once and for all. And not only end slavery, but abolish the system as it is. And so I think people are getting energized by that. We’re also going to break bread with people and just spend time with our community as we should. And so with COVID and everything else, it’s been a long time coming since people have been able to get together. I think we’re all really looking forward to the 21st, and honoring the Attica uprising, and just so many things that folks sacrificed behind the wall and honoring all of that history on Aug. 21. And so, yeah, if you follow our page legalservicesforprisonerswithchildren.org, you’ll be able to see kind of the flyer in different ways. If you’re in the area, you’ll be able to come through and spend some time with us, if you’re in California. And if you’re not, there’s other ways that you can impact the community. We’re always accepting donations, or just however you want to get involved. Just tap in with us on our website, or you could always reach out to me or John or any of us, other organizers on the ground. Eddie Conway: OK. John, you say you got out in November, and you hit the ground, and you actually were lucky because you plugged into some positive people and you got, obviously, a great mentor. What’s happening inside … when you came in contact with the older brothers or mentors inside, and they shoved some books in your face and told you to learn. And obviously you’re in great shape, so they took you to the weight room. So what’s happening inside now? Is there a movement of some sort inside that you are in contact with that can help this effort that you are involved in, now, in terms of their outside family members plugging in? Can you talk a little bit about that? What did you leave behind? And if nothing, then what should be done? John Cannon: So when I left, I left a lot of good comrades in there, and I’m still in contact with a bunch of the fellows and also getting them to join All of Us or None. We have an All of Us or None inside membership, also. We’re not just outside, so we keep them up to date. We have a newsletter, we keep them up to date. We answer letters. But also, personally, I have–my brothers are in there. So they’re joining a movement, too, spreading the word and trying to spread the knowledge. And it’s a big movement. A lot of my friends still in there, a lot of good people, a lot of good men in there. A lot of good women in there, too. Eddie Conway: OK. Jeronimo, just bounce for a minute and talk about this movement center that y’all just purchased and developing. Talk about that a little bit. I’m impressed with that. Jeronimo Aguilar: Yeah. Well, upon getting the fellowship, I headed to the headquarters in Oakland, and it’s called the Freedom and Movement Center. It’s on 4400 Market Street in Oakland. And I was blown away, honestly. When you go in, you see a big banner that says ‘welcome home,’ because Dorsey Nuun, our executive director, prides himself on welcoming people home that are inside for a lot of years. And especially a lot of our elders. A lot of people that have been in there for decades. And so we create a space that it’s all about community. It’s all about welcoming folks after a lot of traumatic years, whether in the system or incarcerated. And so there we have what’s called the ancestor wall where we, basically, we have pictures of just tons of different activists and leaders over the years. It’s just–it’s really a sight to see. And so the Freedom and Movement Center is somewhere where I know that I have felt at home from day one. It’s somewhere that you can be yourself. Like John said, we’re encouraged to speak on our own voice. And a lot of times it’s a lot of pain. It’s a lot of pain that we go through. And so having a space where we can vent and we can talk with each other and we could really be family and community, it’s integral to the movement. We really need those types of spaces. So it kind of reminds me of when I used to read about the Panthers and the Berets, and they would have community centers where folks would come together. It’s really a throwback in that sense. Somewhere where we can all break bread and communion and really just love on each other and support each other, and also strategize on how we can make things better in our community. And so anybody that’s ever in California, I would say, man, make sure you make a trip out to 4400 Market Street to the Freedom and Movement Center, pay a visit to us. We’re going to welcome you with some love, with some food, and just talk community, talk movement with you. And so it’s been a great experience. I think it’s in a great location, being the roots in Oakland. The roots run really deep. And so that movement center is somewhere where people can really dig them roots in, you know what I mean, and get planted. And so the Freedom and Movement Center is a big part of the work that we do. Eddie Conway: OK. Final words, John. If you had an opportunity to just speak to the public and let them know what that experience does to people, juveniles, adults, men and women, when you throw them in cages, that–what would you say that they should take away from that experience? John Cannon: I will say that it’s not humane. It’s really traumatizing. It’s really not human. It closes you in and it forces you to be a certain way, because you’re locked in there like animals. So it kind of forces you to act like that. And then people will judge you based off of the circumstance or based off of where you’ve been, but it’s not a humane thing to do. It’s not it. Eddie Conway: OK. Got you. That’s loud and clear. Jeronimo, you get the final word here. If you want to just speak to the public about your work or what they need to be doing, or why they should be doing something, what would you say? Jeronimo Aguilar: We got 30 All of Us or None chapters in 16 states, and we’re starting to mobilize on the federal level. I would say whatever state that you’re in, whatever area you’re in, either look up All of Us or None–it don’t have to be us. Look up community orgs that are out there trying to liberate, trying to organize and agitate the system. Get involved. I think that so many of us can sit on the sidelines and just be on social media, these other things, and not really get active. And so I would say get active. Join ABC, Abolish Bondage Collectively, that’s a good way for you to get involved in the abolitionist network that we’re creating. And really, it’s not like you’re joining and we’re going to be telling you, all right, here’s the marching order. You’re going to have a chance to really jump in and get involved and help create, because that’s really what we’re all about–learning from each other, building community, and educating each other. And so that’s what I would say is, people get involved, look up Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, All of Us or None. Like I said, we got chapters all over the nation. And let’s make sure that we right these wrongs of the past, and that we abolish slavery once and for all. And once we abolish slavery–and I just want to mention that we amend this part of the Constitution, and that’s not the end of the fight. Colorado, Utah, Nebraska, they’ve already done that. But that’s just the beginning. Because it’s not like the system is going to all of a sudden be paying people $20 an hour to do work. They’re going to struggle against us as well. And so after that is going to be the real fight, and making sure that our people inside are organized. That we’re going on strikes, or we’re unionizing, we’re doing what we need to do in order to make sure that we’re maximizing and capitalizing off that legal right that we have once it’s out of the Constitution. And so I want to emphasize that this is barely the beginning. Once we amend this Constitution on the state level in California, we’ll amend it federally. And once we do that, it’s going to take a big, large organizing effort of our folks to make sure that the system is being held accountable and that people are being treated humanely and being paid a living wage, because that’s only going to help reduce recidivism. It’s only going to uplift our communities. We understand that our mothers and our families take a lot of the toll when we’re inside. Economically, they’re supporting us. They’re charging us for everything. You just had somebody on here about the phone calls, right? There’s companies out here that are capitalizing off of every single aspect, whether it’s food, a phone call, a visit. And so we want to make sure that we’re struggling against that and that we’re making sure that our next generation don’t have to deal with slavery on any level. Eddie Conway: I said this was the final word, but you said something that made me want to ask you one more question. You said the constitution were amended in Colorado and a couple other states. Are you saying that second Amendment piece was taken–Talk about that for a minute, because I wasn’t aware of that. How many states, and what does it mean? Jeronimo Aguilar: So, Utah, Nebraska, and Colorado, to my knowledge–I might be missing one–but there’s a few states that have, through organizing efforts that we’re trying to do, were able to amend their state constitution to remove the exception clause. And so what that did is that gave people inside, as soon as they continue to be exploited, they were able to have legal rights. So whether that’s litigation or lawsuits in order to sue the state and say, hey, hold up, you guys can’t pay us pennies on the dollar anymore, that is removed. And so we have legal bounds now to fight for our rights. And so that’s basically what’s been happening. In Colorado, there’s a lot of lawsuits going down with the inmates, as far as folks fighting for their rights, fighting for the right to be paid some kind of wage. And so we want to make sure that we’re pushing that line here in California as well. Article 1 Section 6 is where that exception lies. And so we want to make sure once we amend that that people inside know their rights. Because a lot of them are just going to continue to work, continue to be pushed into these systems, not knowing any better. And so we–it’s on us to make sure that our folks inside are educated, and understand that, hold on, now, the constitution removed the exception. So now you have the right to demand a fair wage. And so that’s going to take a whole other phase of organizing and educating. So we’re just excited to be part of this entire process. And California, man, it’s really–it’s a huge, like I said earlier, it’s a influential state in the nation. So I really, really strongly feel that if we’re able to amend the constitution here, it’s going to have large repercussions across the nation. And so the amount of money that’s made off of exploited labor here in California is exponential. And so once we attack that part of the prison-industrial complex, that’s going to be a cornerstone that falls. And hopefully we continue to just rip away at the system and rebuild it, like I said earlier, and rebuild it in a more humane way, in a way that all of us are treated humanely. And we talk about love and restoration and redemption instead of just punitive laws that keep us in cells, keep us in cages. Eddie Conway: OK. That was the last word. John, Jeronimo, thanks for joining me. Jeronimo Aguilar: It’s an honor, Mr. Conway. And like I said earlier, it’s an honor to be with you. Eddie Conway: OK. All right. And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. The 13th Amendment outlaws slavery except as punishment for a crime. That means that Black and Brown people in prisons all over the country are forced to work for low or no wages, while others profit. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway speaks with California organizers Jeronimo Aguilar and John Cannon about why we must fight to eradicate the last vestiges of slavery and how they are using legislation and other methods to get the job done. Jeronimo Aguilar is an Elder Freeman Policy Fellow at Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, where he is working on local and statewide legislative efforts including the Vision Act and Oakland Rejects Slavery. John Cannon is a Policy Fellow at Legal Services for Prisoners with Children and an organizer with All of Us or None, a grassroots civil and human rights organization fighting for the rights of formerly-and currently-incarcerated people and our families. \n",

      " Content: This week, President Joe Biden extended the Center for Disease Control’s federal eviction moratorium, which covers 90% of renters facing eviction, caving to pressure from progressive Democrats such as Missouri Rep. Cori Bush.  Bush, who has experienced homelessness herself, slept on the steps of the Capitol building for five days to highlight the cruelty of evicting as many as 7 million people during a pandemic. While celebrating the 60-day extension, which carries sharp fines for landlords who defy it, housing advocates are also drawing attention to the fact the moratorium does not halt evictions entirely. The extension is intended to protect renters from eviction for falling behind on rent payments who live in areas the CDC deems to have “substantial” or “high” risk of  COVID-19 exposure, and that includes Baltimore City. \n",

The case of popular police auditor Otto the Watchdog is a cautionary tale of how far prosecutors and cops will go to pursue charges against people who hold them accountable. In this episode, PAR speaks with Otto the Watchdog about his three-year ordeal fighting charges for holding a sign police said was offensive, and why he made the decision not to plead guilty after prosecutors offered him a deal to avoid jail. Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to achieve that goal by examining just how far police and prosecutors will go to quash dissent–a tale of protracted prosecution against a popular auditor named Otto the Watchdog that raises serious questions about the underlying imperative of our country’s criminal justice system. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @TayasBaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us. And I try to answer your comments when I can. Now we’ve got that out of the way. One of our most important tasks on the show is following up on stories we reported on before. It’s something we feel is vital to our mission: letting the cops and the courts know we will not relent when we believe a story warrants our attention. And one of those ongoing tales involves a man who is no stranger to the show. His name is Otto the Watchdog, and he is a hardworking copwatcher and auditor who’s created some of the most memorable videos and tactics in the annals of holding police accountable. Let’s remember it was Otto who spontaneously did this bowing in front of a Texas cop who was harassing him outside a gas station. This incident documented in this video clip was a brilliant and also revealing take on police power. That not only seemed to confound the cops confronted by it, but also created one of the most memorable images I’ve ever seen, on any channel, anywhere. And believe me, I’ve watched a lot of YouTube. \n",

It’s something we feel is vital to our mission: letting the cops and the courts know we will not relent when we believe a story warrants our attention. And one of those ongoing tales involves a man who is no stranger to the show. His name is Otto the Watchdog, and he is a hardworking copwatcher and auditor who’s created some of the most memorable videos and tactics in the annals of holding police accountable. Let’s remember it was Otto who spontaneously did this bowing in front of a Texas cop who was harassing him outside a gas station. This incident documented in this video clip was a brilliant and also revealing take on police power. That not only seemed to confound the cops confronted by it, but also created one of the most memorable images I’ve ever seen, on any channel, anywhere. And believe me, I’ve watched a lot of YouTube. \n",

      " Content: Maximillian Alvarez: Welcome, everyone, to this special video edition of Working People, a podcast about the lives, jobs, dreams, and struggles of the working class today, brought to you in partnership with The Real News Network and In These Times Magazine. My name is Maximillian Alvarez. I’m the editor-in-chief here at The Real News, and thank you so much for joining us. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the terrain of work and the lives of working people in drastic ways. At its height, in April of 2020, the official unemployment rate in the US was nearly 15%. To put that in context, the official unemployment rate peaked at 10% during the height of the Great Recession. Millions of workers lost their jobs over the past year and a half. Millions more saw their work reoriented to remote work, possibly for good. There’s a lot of discussion right now about the future of work after COVID-19 and what it will look like. But it’s also important to understand how the pandemic catalyzed or compounded existing trends in the economy that have remapped the terrain of work over the past half century. With more and more people being funneled into the gig economy meat grinder, and with increasingly monopolistic entities like Amazon absorbing more and more of the economy into itself, and with care work being the fastest growing labor sector, it is equally, if not more important, for us to grapple with these changes–both to better understand the world that we are living in and to better understand how and where a genuine working class politics can develop in the 21st century. To help us navigate these questions, I could not be more honored to be joined by professor Richard Wolff. Richard Wolff is the professor of economics emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a visiting professor in the graduate program in international affairs of the New School University in New York City. He’s the founder of Democracy At Work and host of their nationally syndicated show, Economic Update, which, if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. Professor Wolff’s latest book is The Sickness Is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics Or Itself, which can be found along with his other books, Understanding Socialism and Understanding Marxism, at ww.democracyatwork.info. Professor, thank you so much for joining me today. Richard Wolff: Max, it’s a pleasure to do so and to be a part of The Real News Network and its allied associated entities like In These Times. This is part of what is going to save this country, if anything can. Maximillian Alvarez: Well, it’s an honor to be in that struggle with you. As I said to folks watching and listening to this, if you were not an avid watcher or listener to Wolff’s work and to all the great work being done at Democracy At Work, you absolutely should be, and you need to remedy that right away. Professor, I wanted to really wanted to bring you on to help us navigate these big questions, right? Because as I mentioned at the top of this, there’s a lot of discussion going on right now about what the future of work is going to be after COVID-19. A lot of these discussions were actually happening before the pandemic, whether we were talking about automation, whether we were talking about remote work, whether we were talking about the expansion of the “gig economy” and its model into other labor sectors. But as we mentioned, the pandemic has really catalyzed a kind of extreme change in our economy and in the terrain of work. I don’t think that any of us have fully grasped what those changes are and the effects that they have and are going to have on the lives of working people. I wanted to bring you on to help us navigate this and to help us place this past year and a half in the broader context of the changing economy, both domestically and internationally, and the changing terrain of work since World War II, which is something that you cover beautifully and extensively over at Democracy At Work. So, I think to even begin to have this sort of conversation, as you do so well regularly, it’s important to kind of define our terms. If we’re talking about who and where the working class is in the 21st century, I think it would behoove us to first kind of take a second to talk about what we mean by the term ‘working class.’ On the show Working People, I’ve made it very explicit that I don’t want to actively define this or narrowly define what the working class is, who the working class is, for listeners. I would rather have the stories of different workers in different industries, really piece together a larger understanding of what being working class means. I wanted to turn this over to you and ask: In your own work, and in the discussions that we’re having now about the future of work, how do you think we should be thinking about the term ‘working class’? Who should it include and what should the criteria be? Richard Wolff: Let me begin by saying this is a very, very important question. It’s not an academic exercise, it’s not an abstraction. If we’re going to change the society that we live in in a progressive, new way, then we have to understand what we’re dealing with, and that requires us to take stock of the lay of the land that we’re proposing to change. I would argue, the way I see it is that, depending on what you’re trying to understand or change, that will shape how you define the object you’re working with. It’s a little bit like–if I can use a metaphor–a sculptor, a man or a woman who makes shapes out of the physical universe. But whether you’re working with clay, or whether you’re working with a special kind of plastic, or whether you’re working with ice, I mean, all the different things sculptors have used, well, it affects how they go about their work, what they’re dealing with, and they have to come to a sense of what this medium is. I think we have to do the same, and we have to be flexible. I like your idea of drawing from your audience conceptions of the working class, because there’s not a right and a wrong one. There are lots of different ones, and that has to be faced. With all that background, let me give you the answer I give. For many of the purposes that I have as an analyst and an activist, I divide the society, the capitalist society here in the United States–or, indeed, globally–into two classes to start the conversation. One of them is the class of the employers, and the other one is the class of the employees. For me, I come out of a study of history, I come out of the Marxist tradition. I don’t deny it. I don’t pretend about it. It’s not the only tradition that I have learned from, but it is one of them, and I’m not going to disavow it any more than that I would allow all kinds of other right-wing ideas into my head. Okay, here’s the notion. The slave system had two key positions, master and slave. That doesn’t mean that all the masters were alike, and it doesn’t mean that all the slaves were the same. It doesn’t mean that there weren’t divisions among the slaves. There always were; likewise among the masters. But for certain kind of key purposes of understanding, I work with a distinction between the master and the slave, and I compare it to feudalism, and I see the lord and the serf. And then I come to capitalism, and I see the employer and the employee. The reason I set it up that way is there’s something quite fundamental, not more or less important, but something very fundamental in this society. The master is in charge. Isn’t he? He makes the key decisions. He runs the plantation. He runs the enterprise. He runs whatever you want to call it. And, likewise, the lord over the feudal manor in feudalism. The serf has her position, but it is clearly a subordinate position, and it was one of Marx’s great insights to see that capitalism didn’t, as it thought it did, break from those old ones as completely as it imagined. It broke from them in many ways, but it replicated the split between two key positions. One, a very small minority running the show. And another, a very large majority being either slaves or serfs or employees. I find useful insights into what’s happening by starting there. But then I go another step, because there are lots of differences within the class of employees. For example, and one highlighted in the way I think about it, is the difference between those who, and now to use the Marxian language, produce a surplus. All those people who make the software, the chairs, the hamburgers, the ice cream cones, the shirts, the blouses, all of it. There are people who work transforming nature, lumber and so forth, using tools, for example, hammers and nails, to come up with a finished product, the chair or the table that use that as an example. Those people in the Marxian theory, they do the work that produces the vast bulk of goods and services like the slaves, like the serfs. And they always–one of Marx’s great points–they always produce more of those things, the goods and services, than they themselves consume. In other words, yeah, they make chairs and they sit on chairs. But if you add up all the chairs all the chair makers produce with all the chairs that the working class of people sit on, there’s more chairs. There’s more value than what they, the workers, consume. What is that surplus? That’s the income of the people at the top, the employer class, who are in the business, which they will tell you themselves, to make money, to come away with more than they threw in. There’s no magic here. They haven’t overcome the laws of thermodynamics. They understand that you don’t get out more than you put in. Well, what happens? Well, they’re not getting out more than they’re putting in. What they’re getting out is what they put in, the raw materials, the workers, the technology, and they get out what those things can produce. But what they can produce is more than what they give to their employees as their income, and that more, which they like to call profit, is why they’re in business. They want to get that more from this situation, which they do. That’s why they’re the employer. That’s why they’re in the position of deciding when it’s profitable to hire someone and when it isn’t. That’s why capitalism basically holds all of us that are employees hostage. We’re only going to get a job if it’s profitable for one of them to hire us. Whoa, what a remarkable non-equivalence here. They hire and fire. We hope we’re not among the fired. We seek a job, which they are in a position to give us or take away from us. I then get really interested in the difference between the workers who produce a surplus, the ones who actually make this stuff, and another group of workers, a group of workers just as important as this first group, the ones who make the surplus, but they don’t. They are in charge of creating the conditions that enable a worker to be productive of a surplus. Let me give you an example. The purchasing department of a capitalist enterprise. I’ll stick with my chair example. Someone has to worry to buy the lumber that’s going to be transformed. Somebody has to purchase the nails and hammers and arrange for the electricity that will power the machine. That person isn’t making a chair. That person is doing something else, collecting, buying the inputs. Without that, nothing gets produced. It’s just as important as the worker who, by his brains and muscles, transforms the lumber using the hammer into the chair. So, there’s no ranking of the importance of these workers. You got to have them both. Somebody has to collect the inputs, or this game doesn’t happen, but they’re radically different. One of these people is on the factory floor, and another one of them is sitting in an office. Everything about their experience is different. In many, many ways, they are part of capitalism, they share being employees. The check they get at the end of the week comes from the same core … So, there are key similarities, the things they have in common, but there are, likewise, very profound differences. Capitalism arranges things that way, and we have to understand that when you’re given the divisions of capitalism and your goal is to go beyond the capitalism, you’ve got to take the differences and overcome them. Work with people that respect that they have a different life experience, that they have a different daily life. You have to work that out. There are moments when there are conflicts. For example, the boss is coming down on the guy who, or the man or the woman, who goes out and buys the lumber in our chair story, and they put a lot of pressure on them. They come back and they say, “Well, it’s not my problem. It’s the guys in the shop who are not working the lumber in the right way.” That’s the real, ooh, this now becomes a conflict between two groups of workers, and that has to be faced. That’s going to happen. That’s going to create divisions between workers. But if your project is to get beyond capitalism, you see that not simply as a problem, but as a problem that needs to be solved if you’re going to–here comes the punchline–if out of all the complex differences in the class of employees, you’re going to construct a politically powerful movement strong enough to change the society. I have no doubt that we can do that. I have no doubt that the contradictions of capitalism, the uniqueness of that system, makes it vulnerable. And you know why? Because history teaches no other lesson. Slavery isn’t here anymore. Feudalism isn’t here anymore. In other words, those systems eventually were overthrown. While, yes, they fell apart, that’s part of the story, they were also actively shaped by people who wanted to go beyond that. I’m not going to allocate which is more responsible. The two things work together and made every other system pass. There’s no reason to assume that capitalism has some magical quality that exempts it from this process. The people who like capitalism want us to think that history has stopped and something that happened to every other system will never happen to this one. But my response is always to remind them, in slavery, there were people like that who thought it would never pass. And in feudalism, there were people … Get the picture? The burden isn’t on us who want to change, because that’s been universal. The burden is on the conservatives who imagine that they can keep this from happening to their system. Long story short, we have differences of position within capitalism. The example I gave you, the white … By the way, people have understood these things. I’m not saying anything really new. I’m putting it a little differently, but people have understood, for example, the difference between the blue-collar worker and the white-collar worker. Well, that getting into exactly what I’m talking about. That’s right. Blue collar, white collar, then people later answered pink collar. It becomes more complicated. We know of course, of the differences that we are in our culture, able now to talk about racial differences, gender differences, skill differences, educational differences, age differences. Those are all real. Those are all products, either of capitalism or they’re shaped in a particular way by capitalism, and those are the raw materials out of which you build a class that is conscious of itself, that understands and respects its differences. Doesn’t want to ride roughshod over … We’re not all the same because we share certain things. The things we share are very important, have to be right there. We are wage-earners. We are the order-takers in the capitalist enterprise. In my work, I like to stress that we imagine we got rid of the kings in this world, the monarchies, several centuries ago. And we did, sort of, but the monarchs played a trick. When we got rid of them in politics, they slipped underneath the dividing line and became CEOs in the corporate world. That’s just a king by another name. We are all his subjects. The minute we enter the factory, the office, the store, we are told where to sit, what to do, how to do it, when to go to the bathroom, how long to stay in the bathroom. At the end of the day, when we have poured our brains, our muscles, into the work we have to do, we’re told to get out of there, leave behind everything we did, go home, watch TV, have a beer, eat some pizza, and come back tomorrow and do it again. They’re the kings. We are all the subjects. They’re not accountable to us. We don’t control them. They have the power to hire and fire us. We don’t have the reverse. There’s nothing remotely democratic about any of this. Parentheses, this is in a country which keeps calling itself democratic, but the workplace never was. We never allowed one bit of democracy. If you confronted a CEO today with a democratic demand, that everybody in the enterprise should have one person, one vote, and we should decide by majority rule what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do with the profits we all help to make, they will fire us. And that will end that conversation really quickly. For me, I’m very optimistic. We haven’t done a good job. I’m critical, but I’m optimistic. We can do what every other system’s people have done. We could get together and figure out, with respect for what differentiates us, an achievement of unity strong enough to make a transition to a system that will be better for all of us. For me, I’m just impatient that we haven’t gotten further along on this project than we have. Maximillian Alvarez: Well, I think your impatience is warranted and something that we should all be feeling to some degree, right? I mean, because–Look around you. We are seeing the catastrophic effects of climate change. We are living in a state of extreme wealth inequality and political inequality that coincides with that. We are perpetually in a state of war. When I say we, I largely mean the United States, but there are a lot of serious threats to the world that we live in and our ability to live dignified lives within it right now. I think that I really want to underscore for viewers and listeners that those are the stakes of what we’re talking about. If we know that this society is untenable, then we need, kind of, political solutions to change it. Doing so requires building a critical mass of people who will push in that direction. Therein lies the traditional Marxist program of building a politics out of the working class–A, because the working class is there, like professor Wolff said, at the very heart, at the genesis, of everything that drives this sort of system, everything that makes profits possible. Working people are the ones moving the gears of this system; thus, they are best placed to stop those gears and reorient that system. But building that sort of base of working class people and organizing in the direction that professor Wolff was talking about, by finding those commonalities, by respecting those differences, by building political engines and organs that can actually express the power and rage of the working class, that is the continual conundrum that we are faced with. That is why it’s actually really important to think about the definition that professor Wolff gave. Because when we talk about who or what the working class is, there are a lot of, I guess, business school-type definitions that look at how much a person earns–Which we know is not necessarily a great indicator, because if you’re making $30,000 in New York City, that’s different than making $30,000 in rural Nebraska. There’s also categorical definitions, like whether or not someone has a college degree or what kind of job they do. These are all helpful for understanding the divisions within the larger class that professor Wolff described. But, ultimately, I wholeheartedly agree that there’s something really valuable in thinking about the large historical distinctions between not just the haves and have-nots, but–as you said–the owners and the workers, slaves and masters, lords and serfs, the order-givers and the order-takers in our society. I think that that’s something that is really important for all of us to sit with right now, especially because I think there’s a big tendency for us to gatekeep over who is and isn’t in the working class. And we use a lot of those sorts of definitions to do so, but when it comes down to it, the vast amount of us are not in the order-giver category. I wanted to actually use that to talk about how that sort of category of order-givers and order-takers, of owners and workers, the ruling class and the working class, has really developed over the course of the past half century, and even more. You recently did an incredible lecture laying out the political and economic development of the US and China side by side. You did so with an incredible narrative power that you always demonstrate that I think gives people a really clear sense of where we are and where we’re going. I wanted to ask if we could harness that, that narratorial power that you have, to help people understand how the terrain of the working class, who and what it is, where they’re working, and what their conditions for living and working are; how that has developed over that similar arc that you traced in your recent lecture on the US and China’s development. Richard Wolff: Sure. Let me try to do that and pick up on something you said at the very beginning of this discussion. I’m always impressed that the working class, the employees–using that general term for the moment–how they are always fighting. There are always elements of working class that are doing exactly what I suspect will eventually change this system; namely, pushing against the power of capital, resisting the order-givers, demanding in their own time and in their own way to give some orders, here. It might help if I talk about some of these struggles right now, and then show you how they reflect the evolution of the working class in this country. To do so, I’m going to start with an example from Europe, and then you’ll see that it applies to the United States. Europe went through a remarkable change 20 years ago when it stopped being a collection of independent divided countries that had had two horrific world wars in the 20th century among them; the British, the Germans, the French, the Spanish, the Italians, Scandinavians, and all of that. And they unified. They created a unified … something called the European Union, or sometimes the United States of Europe, and so forth. This was discussed in terms of overcoming the wars among them, that they would now be unified rather than at each other’s throats in such terrible ways. And they could better compete with the United States, which was a unified country, and so on. That was the language. Underneath the language was a very different capitalist reality. The capital, the employers in each government, had the power and the foresight to dominate how that new unified thing would work. What they did was to use it to enhance all the things they were doing to pull more profits out of the working class and to squash all the initiatives of the working class to fight back, and it changed the terrain of politics, of the culture, of everything else about Europe. The promise that a unified Europe would be a great thing for the mass of people proved to be completely erroneous. It was a heyday for the capitalists. One of the remarkable ways that you might find interesting was the transition from the individual currencies, the German mark, the French franc, the Italian lira, whatever it was, to the euro, the one that we’re now familiar with. Every business in Europe, virtually every business, use the transition to play a little hustle, to actually make the price in euros higher for whatever they sold from what it was before. That was never intent of a unified currency, but it was used to make money. An analogy for you all right now: There’s discussion in the United States, and over the last year, we’ve had an inflation in the United States. That’s true. Prices are generally about 5%, 5.5% higher now than they were a year ago. Some prices have really gone crazy. Used cars are up 30%, and so forth. Well, let me remind you what an inflation is. An inflation has to do with a general rise of prices. Here we go, now. Who sets prices in a capitalist system? Answer: the employer. Who has to pay the prices that everything has? The employees. Inflation is a kind of class war. It is an ability of those in a position to set the prices, to jack them up, and the rest of us, we have to take whatever money we get, and we can afford fewer things now, because the prices have gone up. They raised the price to make more profits. That’s why they do everything. We are going to have to take it on the chin because we can’t … Our standard of living is going down at a rate of 5% a year, which is very high, and they’re making more money. Nobody discusses that. The inflation is discussed in abstract terms, as if we all face this together. That was what they did in Europe. We’re all going to have the euro together. We’re all going to have a unified Europe. Yeah, but it’s a very different story for some than for others. Here’s another example of how things have changed. The COVID shutdown of a year and a half basically meant very different things in this society. A number of Americans now get that, and they’re very angry, when we spent the last week watching, some of us, how Mr. Bezos and Mr. Branson competed to spend their billions in a race into space while there were masses of homeless people, hungry people. I mean, you couldn’t be grosser than that. But let’s go further. Over these last 18 months, let’s take a look. The rich became richer. You all know the numbers. If you take the 600 billionaires in the United States and you add up their wealth, it’s in the trillions, and they got almost a trillion more over the last 16 months, 18 months. Meanwhile, 82–it’s the latest count that I have–82 million American workers had to go on unemployment at some point over the last 18 months. Some of them were only unemployed a few weeks. Some of them weren’t employed the whole time. But that’s more than half the labor force of the United States. That is a staggering statistic. More than one out of two. The American labor force is numbered roughly 160 million. Well, if 82 million had to go on unemployment for a period of time, that’s more than one out of two. You know, when you’re unemployed, your self-esteem suffers, your income suffers, you use up whatever savings you might have had, you lean on your friends, your relatives, in ways they cannot tolerate, because they’re having their problems right now real well, which means alcoholism, spouse abuse, divorce, all of these things. Mental and physical ailments. We subjected our working class to a staggering imposition around what–we’re all struggling through COVID together. That’s like, we’re all unifying Europe together. BS is what that was. Some of us are making money off of it, and others of us are losing our shirts. But here is another dimension. During those 18 months, every business in the United States saw an opportunity. They couldn’t all take advantage of it, but many have. They began to rethink, under a lot of pressure, how they ran their business. They were losing money. You don’t make a profit if your workers aren’t there, if they can’t come into work because they’re sick, or they’re afraid of getting sick, or there’s a lockdown, or whatever it is. All capitalists learned or relearned a lesson. You can have great machines, you can have fantastic technology; you don’t have the worker, you got nothing. Without the worker they didn’t get their profits. Now they can reopen, but they learned something. If we’re going to recoup the profits we didn’t get for 18 months, we’re going to have to get more out of what we’re doing now. And they studied, because they’re not stupid, and they hired people. Some of my students work for the companies they hired, which is how I know about this. Here’s what they did. I’m going to give you a little example. With this department over here, we have had five people, but if we rearrange it a little bit, we’re going to call back four people, not five. We can get this work done with four salaries, not five, and you know how this is playing out? There’s a statistic the government keeps that is off the chart. It’s called the statistic of quitting. Workers are brought back to their jobs, sometimes from the get-go they see, but sometimes it takes a few days, a few weeks. You know what? They realized what’s happening. Not only were they screwed during this COVID disease, but they’re about to be screwed for the rest of their lives, because they’re not getting the pay they did before, or they’re not getting the benefits they did before, or they’re made to do more work than they were before without getting any extra pay. And their answer is, I quit. Because the quit numbers are off the chart. That, for us, should be a fantastic opportunity, because it’s workers pushing back. It hurts to quit. You don’t want to quit, but you are so angry. You understand, even if it only in the little personal perspective of what you see, what’s being done to you. You’re being ripped off. Now, your point, Max. All of this stuff has been going on before. You don’t need COVID. Your employers are always looking for how to shave a job here or how to save over there. There are whole courses in business schools, how to–they’re very polite–they’re how to “economize on labor costs.” That’s a nice way of saying screw a worker out of a job, or get more out of her than you pay her, etc. But the reality is we have been in an environment, particularly since the 1970s, when American capitalism had the end of its special time. What do I mean? World War II destroyed all capitalist systems in the world except the United States. The British were wiped out. The Germans were wiped out. The Japanese were wiped out. Their factories were largely destroyed. Their working classes decimated by the war. These were countries whose capitalism had brought them to the brink of disaster, with one exception, forgetting for a moment about Pearl Harbor. There was no war on American territory, on US territory, other than at Pearl Harbor. Our railroads were intact, our harbors were fine. Our working class had been put back to work by the war. So, we came out of it in a fantastic profitable situation. 1945-1975, 30 special years. By the 1970s, the special was over. The Japanese had come back. The Germans likewise. That’s why we’re all driving German and Japanese cars, aren’t we? And it all got going then, didn’t it? And American capitalism found itself competing. No longer in charge, no longer the dominant society that was controlling everything. It began to have real competitors. I want to express to all of you: at that point, the capitalists did what they always do, but extra. They had to find a way to compete, and so they came down on their working class. They really went to work to smash the unions, and they did a really good job. They really went to work to smash their competitors if they could, to subordinate them if they could. And when they couldn’t beat them, they joined them. What did that mean? They took the factories out and they went to wherever the labor was cheaper, wherever they could get the job done by someone else. That begins what we used to call the de-industrialization of the United States; the end of New England as an industrial hub, the end of the Midwest as an industrial hub. The movement of whatever was left to the Southwest, to the South, to California, because they could get more profits there than they could in the heartland that was politically organized by the working class that make it a little harder for them. And so begins what I just described with COVID, and COVID is kind of the last step of it, but it has been going on for decades before that, which is why Americans feel pressured, stressed. There’s never quite enough money. The 1970s, they did the biggest thing, which in a way is the most tragic. They stopped raising the wages. Before that, they got so much profit they could give a little back to the workers who could get a few percentages every year. In the 1970s, it stopped. For those of you not familiar, the real wage, what an hour’s worth of work will enable you to buy, is not much larger today than it was in 1978. Wow. Over all the intervening 40 years, workers became more productive in America. And all that more productive means, in an hour, the average worker gave the employer more output each year, but the employer who pays the wage gave the worker the same. What worker gives employer goes up. What employer gives worker is the same. You don’t need a genius to understand. Of course the rich get richer, they’re getting the growth. The working class isn’t. But because we didn’t organize them then, because this wasn’t the story that was explained to them, because there was no organization to pull all this together, individual American workers thought it was their problem. Not this social development, not this economic reality. You know what they did? Really, it’s tragic. They worked more hours. You know, if you’re not getting paid any more per hour like you’re used to, well, then you got to do more hours. They had the men in the family do more hours. If the women weren’t leaving the home to get a paid job out there, they began doing it in record numbers. Yeah, they might’ve called it women’s liberation, and there was an element of that there, for sure, but it was also a family’s budgetary necessity. Then they did this thing, which–again, if you have any compassion at all, here’s your moment for it. The American working class tried to hold on to its rising standard of living over the previous century, but wages no longer allowed it. Wages didn’t cover it. Wages couldn’t afford it. So, they did that thing we all know. They became pioneers of a new kind. They borrowed more money than any working class in the history of the world ever borrowed. More money for your mortgage, for your home, money to buy your car on time, money in your credit card to buy the bottled water at the neighborhood bodega. Then the last one of the last 30 years, college debt. I mean, we’re a society that lives on a fantasy that this is all going to work out all right. 2008 was the wake up call. Not working, can’t pay, prime mortgage, all that vague noise, that’s the end of the borrowing binge. There’s no binge left. Now the squeezing is getting harder because there’s no fantasy offset of credit. People are desperate now. The COVID is now forcing those who are employers, if they’re going to survive, to squeeze even harder, and it’s making life extremely difficult. The interesting thing is, it’s making the working class, if I dare use this term, come a little bit out of hibernation like a bear, beginning, almost to have to face. Despite all of the education in the other direction, the schools, the politicians, the media pushing the other way, working people are beginning to understand what they face, and who their allies might be, and who their enemies are. I can’t think of a better set of circumstances in which the project of taking the different components of the working class and showing them the parallel pressures coming out of a system that no longer works for the majority of people. It hasn’t for decades. It could have made that claim before the ’70s, because at least while the rich got richer, the working class, most of it, the white part particularly, had a rising standard of living, but they can’t make those claims anymore. None of that is true. That reality, no matter what fantasies the Donald Trumps and the Tucker Carlsons invent, powerful as they are, that they face a reality that isn’t going to go away, that the very forces they serve are making worse. People ask me, in kindness, why has my audience over the last 10 years grown? And believe me, I’m as overwhelmed by it as anybody observing it. Does it gratify my ego? Of course, how could it not? But it isn’t me. I’m not saying things that are all that different from what I said 10 or 20 or 30 years ago. I’m a little bit like that person who whistles a tune that’s irritating and annoying for years, and then suddenly people say, “Hey, what’s that tune? That’s really good. I would love to see …” It ain’t me. Same thing I’ve been whistling all along. That’s the good news, because it’s the audience that has changed, and that was the goal all along. I’m enthralled. And you pick up optimism from me, that’s my experience. That’s not wishful thinking. That’s what I’m watching as I see. I recently noted, I had an interview on my program with–I won’t mention names–with the head of the AFL-CIO in the state of Vermont. Now, a bunch of progressive young people ran for office in the State of Vermont in the AFL-CIO system. And they won, they won elections. A majority of the union voters went for them. They’re taking all kinds of progressive stands. They’re pushing, and they’re working with a labor movement that’s solidly behind them. Now, it’s irritating other parts of the labor movement that isn’t ready to do that yet, but that’s been what we’ve had for a long time. What’s new, what’s exciting, and what is young. Are these new? These are extremely important. I just picked that one because it’s in my head. I could give you a dozen other examples. They’re in your program. They’re in In These Times. They’re in reports of the Real News Network. And that’s as it should be. We are witnessing something that is, in my judgment–and this is a new thing, I haven’t thought this until the last couple of years–I’ve always noticed that capitalism has enormous resiliency. I admire it. It’s come through a lot of really difficult moments and figured out ways to survive, or even to grow. I’ve usually been able to figure out, oh yeah, it has this. If this happens, they can get out. If this … I got to tell you though, as a professional economist, which is what I am, I’ve been teaching economics all my life, I don’t see a way out. I just don’t. And for me, I don’t know why I don’t. I look for it. I don’t want to be saying things are … if I can see a way out. But I cannot. The problems of the United States have been kicked down the road so long. They’ve amounted–you see it all around us, whether it’s in white supremacy, or whether it’s in dead end jobs, or it’s this unbelievable inequality that we continue to make worse, the system isn’t … It isn’t even able to deal with the problems it sees, let alone the ones that it doesn’t see. So, for me, I think I’m watching the end. The United States is one of the richest countries in the world. We have one of the most developed medical systems in the world, and we’re number one in the people who died of COVID. That is a level of failure that is epoch-making. People who look back and ask, when did the feudal system in Europe, which lasted a thousand years, when was it over? And the answer most come to is they point to something that happened in the 13th and 14th centuries, which we now call the black plague, the bubonic plague, the black death. It was a pandemic like we’ve just been through. Worse, but like we’ve just been through. I’m beginning to wonder, and I’m not the only one, whether this level of failure to cope will not, in fact, be what historians remember was the signal that there’s something fundamentally wrong here. We have the people who can do the work. We have the factories that can make the tests, the masks, the ventilators, all of it. We have it, but our system can’t. Just like we have all the work to be done in our society that could give good jobs to all the unemployed tomorrow. We all know we can make a list of what we need. Save us from planetary self-destruction, green this country, do something for the aging population besides stick them in nursing homes with inadequate care. Come on, we know what needs to be done. We have the people who want to do the work. We have the work needing to be done, and we have the tools and equipment. The Federal Reserve keeps a record–it’s called factory or capacity utilization is the name. And that measures how many of our tools, equipment, factories, what proportion is being used for production, and what is sitting idle gathering rust and dust. It’s about 20%, 25% that’s gathering rust and dust. Why do I mention it to you? We have the equipment, the tools, the factory. We have the workers who want work, and we have the work needing to be done. And this system can not put it together, because unless there’s profit in it, nothing happens. We’re held hostage. For me, the very ability you and I have in this moment to have this conversation is itself a symptom that this system is over. Maximillian Alvarez: I mean, I think that that’s incredibly powerfully put. In a way, it’s something that I think we all know or sense implicitly, because the evidence is all around us. We see the decay, we see the, kind of, crumbling infrastructure, the very physical decay of this, the richest nation in the world, right? We feel the squeeze and our inability to keep up with the cost of living. We see how the resources that could enable us, as a society, to tackle the world historical issues that we currently face, the climate change, inequality, war, and so on. We see those resources available, and we see where they’re going to. We are having this conversation just a day after Jeff Bezos returned from the very edge of space, and almost to spit in the face of every working person in the country, said thank you to every Amazon worker and customer; you paid for this. That is where that surplus is going. It is going to a billionaire space race. It is getting siphoned off and pocketed in offshore accounts. It is not going back into the society that is experiencing the rot and living through that rot. I’m really appreciative that we ended up at this point professor–and I know I’ve only got you for a couple minutes–because I think, in one way, I was approaching this conversation thinking about, again, those specific categories of work. Maybe we’ll have to have a follow-up conversation about that, because before the pandemic, the biggest categories of work included things like retail salesperson, fast food and counter workers, cashiers, registered nurses, but the fastest growing sector of the workforce was care work. You’ve mentioned that the boomer generation is now the largest aging generation that the United States has seen, and the only sort of economic solution for providing jobs, for producing something in this country, that we have right now is really just to funnel the younger generation to care for the aging generation, or push people into gig work and piecework. As far as the big strokes of the economy go, like you said, American capitalism has no answer for working people to reach that kind of comfortable existence. It’s going to take more than just the kind of jobs we have or the amount that we’re able to earn to secure that middle-class existence. The rot goes much deeper. In the last couple of minutes that I have you, I wanted to ask, in terms of really cohering that message and really trying to bridge those gaps among the order-takers of our society, be they white-collar workers in office buildings, be they janitors or gig workers in California, in Texas, how do we use this sort of larger narrative of capitalist decay and really find the ties that bind the working class and mobilize that large group of order-takers and non-owners to push for the kind of political future that we need? Richard Wolff: Well, I think the answer is very ancient. I think the system, as it crumbles, enables the old truisms to take on a new shine, a new urgency, a new echo in people’s feelings and thoughts as we go forward. Let’s remember, the reason we import billions and billions of goods from China, or from Vietnam, or from any of the other … is because overwhelmingly, American corporations closed their operations in the United States and moved them there. People used to say, in general, about 50% of what comes from China is coming from the subsidiary of an American corporation. If you add partnerships, it’s even bigger number that do that. This is a way the capitalist system made more money. It isn’t going to come back from that. Everything it does is built on that. They’re not coming back. For example, every one of the last half dozen presidents has said, “I’m going to bring manufacturing back.” Every one of them lied. They lied because they couldn’t do it. And they shouldn’t have claimed that they could. Biden, by the way, keeps that tradition, the silly tradition going. There’s good reason. The system adjusts to the levels of profits it’s earned. It increased its profitability over the last 30, 40 years by globalization, by taking the jobs out, by bringing lower-paid people in as immigrants, by the automation–most important of all of them–of the computerization and the robotization, and all the rest. They’re not going back. They can’t. Their institutions, their finances, everything depends on it. Why am I saying this? Because they are going, if they give any jobs to the mass of Americans, they’re going to give them what David Graeber called “bullshit jobs.” They’re going to give them empty paper shuffling, or fast food, or caring for the elderly, and they’re not going to pay them anything, and they’re not really going to care what kind of care is given in those institutions. I expect we will be seeing and hearing reports of unspeakable conditions in the care facilities for these older generations. I mean, an ugliness is unfolding in front of us. People got shocked when Mr. Trump put immigrant children in cages on our Southern border. But that’s a symptom, that this is now tolerable. You’re accustoming a society that will blame the victims, which are a growing part of our population. That’s why I say I don’t see a way out. Because in the earlier periods, United States had no competitors. I don’t want to scare people, but the People’s Republic of China is a very serious competitor. Not militarily; and who knows, that may end our planet. But in every other way, they have figured out how to grow economically much faster than this country. And with their growth, they have grown at the rate three times the United States for the last 40 years. I mean, and with that comes the political influence. They handled this medical crisis of COVID way better than we did, with four times the population, and a poorer country to begin with. You cannot keep this hustle going. I think what Americans have to understand is the shift from a regular job to a gig job, to having to have three jobs that you run between every week as the norm, that a new … These are all details of a crunching down on the working class in this country. We are not anymore going to be here looking at the rest of the world on our geography TV show, how much less they got. We are entering where they have always been, and that’s a terrible difficulty. Look at the British. They still can’t quite get over that they don’t have an empire anymore, but the actual reality of the British working class is a disaster now. That’s what’s facing the American working class. Are you really willing to have it ratcheted down step by step? Now you lost your job, now the prices are going up too much, now you have to run around even harder for your gig job. Now you have no insurance that covers you for this or for that. You’re being attacked at a hundred different points. At some point, only a class movement will solve your problem. These are social problems. Americans still experience them as if they were individual problems. They’re social problems. It is an impossible task to give yourself, to imagine that you, as an individual, can solve the social problem. The way you solve social problems is with social movements that make social changes. Otherwise you are just beating yourself up, and you’re really two steps away from confronting a life that’s falling apart and spending a lot more time, as we used to say, with Jim Beam. Maximillian Alvarez: Well, on that note, I think we can call this a wrap. Again, these are the stakes, this is the task, and the time is very much now. Professor Richard Wolff, founder of Democracy At Work and host of their show, Economic Update, I can’t thank you enough for joining me. To everyone watching, please go check out Democracy At Work, support all the great work that they do. Professor, thank you so much, and I hope to chat to you again soon. Richard Wolff: Absolutely, and let’s continue the discussion about the American working class. I feel as though we just began, and there’s a lot more work to do, so let’s do it again sometime soon. Maximillian Alvarez: Yes, let’s please do that. Let’s make this the first of many conversations. It was a real honor to talk to you, professor.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the nature of work and the lives of working people in drastic ways. Millions of workers lost their jobs over the past year and a half, millions more saw their in-person jobs reoriented to remote work, possibly for good. While there is a lot of discussion right now about what the future of work will look like after COVID-19, it’s important to understand how the pandemic accelerated existing trends in the economy that have been remapping the terrain of work and the makeup of the working class over the past half century. In this special video edition of Working People, TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez talks with world-renowned economist Richard D. Wolff about what these trends tell us about the global evolution of capitalism and how we can forge a diverse working-class political coalition in the 21st century that is capable of building a political and economic system that works for all of us. Richard D. Wolff is Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and a visiting professor in the Julien J. Studley Graduate Programs in International Affairs at the New School in New York City; he is also the founder of Democracy at Work and host of their nationally syndicated show Economic Update.

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. Because of COVID-19, the pandemic, and a huge amount of people have been unemployed or refusing to go back to work, multinational corporations, and even small businesses, have been taken advantage of prison labor. They’ve been using the prison industrial complex to fill out their rosters and to get cheap labor. Joining me today to give us an overview of this is Michael Sainato. Michael, thanks for joining me. Michael Sainato: Oh, thanks for having me, Eddie. Eddie Conway: OK. Now, you’ve recently written an article about this, and you talk about the multinational corporation. Give us a little background. What’s been changed? Because, obviously, corporations have been using prison labor since slavery. What’s been changed now? Michael Sainato: Well, once the pandemic started, you had a lot of states look to prison labor to make PPE, to make hand sanitizer. And these workers were making 40 cents an hour or two. Some states weren’t paying any of these workers at all, and that’s because, like you said, this has been around since the 13th Amendment, since slavery ended. Prisoners in the US are not protected by any basic labor protections that we all have. The Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA, the National Labor Relations Act. It’s really a non-transparent source of labor for companies and a way for state and federal correction departments to make money off of incarcerating Americans. Eddie Conway: OK. So, go back for a minute and just talk about the PPE, because some of the people in the audience might not know what that means. What does that mean? Because I recall how they were using prisoners at the beginning of the pandemic. Talk about how they treated those prisoners, prisoners that were doing that, and especially in New York and in other places. Michael Sainato: In New York, I’m sure a lot of us were introduced to that really smelly hand sanitizer in the pandemic. It’s really alcohol-based. A lot of that was produced in prisons. I know Gov. Cuomo in New York got New York prisoners to make that, so this was like an emergency production. And prison labor was used as a cheap, efficient way to get that stuff made. Masks, the protective gear, things like that, those were made in a lot of states by prison labor. Eddie Conway: Yeah, and what struck me at the time was that prisoners were not even allowed to use the hand sanitizer or receive the masks, or they didn’t get the protection that we provided for the public through their labor. I thought that was criminal. All of it’s criminal. But now, give me a couple examples today of companies since then came online and that are using prison labor, and what’s the qualification? What’s the criteria for using prisoners like that? Michael Sainato: The federal prison system has its own system where corporations can partner and use federal prisoners for their own labor, and that information is released eventually, but at the state level, it’s hard to get that data of what’s being produced with prison labor. A lot of these companies use shell companies, so there’s a lot of lack of transparency. In a few of the examples I cite in the story I did for the Guardian, in Kansas, there’s Russell Stover. I’m sure everyone is familiar with the candy company. They have a manufacturing production plant out in Kansas, and they were reportedly experiencing issues in finding enough workers. For the past few months, we’ve all been hearing about labor shortage issues and whether the data actually shows that, or whether it’s employers who don’t want to pay adequate wages and benefits. But in this case, this candy company went to the Kansas Department of Corrections, which already had a program in place with over 40 private corporations, and said, “We want workers. We’ll pay them this amount.” And they have a contract where they’re guaranteed a number of workers every day, every week. That’s appealing to them, and they pay them less than their average workforce. These particular workers are getting paid a lot more than most workers in the prison labor industry at $14 an hour, which is great for these individuals, but it drives down wages. In that area, everyone else is getting over $15 an hour to over $20 an hour just to start off with, plus benefits. Obviously, working out of a prison, these people are not getting days off. They’re not getting paid time off. They’re even being charged to take a two-hour bus ride to the plant and then two hours back, so that’s a 12-hour day for them. Four hours on a bus. Eddie Conway: You make a point, and it’s important, that they even pay for being kept in prison. 25% of that particular pay that they get each day and an additional 5% goes to the victims fund, and I calculated it, so that leaves them about $9, minus probably the $2 that they have to pay for transportation. That’s not a tremendous amount of money. So they’re getting labor, cheap labor, for half price. Being a former prisoner, I worked for $6.50, and I was part of the upper middle class in the prison system at the time, back in the day. Prisons want those kind of jobs. What do you say to people that say, “Look, this is giving them a skill. They’re learning to make chocolate, and they got a few dollars to save.” What do you say to people? There’s not too much you can say to a prisoner about that, but what’s the explanation for that being a luxury job and people in the larger society saying that it’s not right? Michael Sainato: To start off with, these programs aren’t being created with the best interest of the prisoners in mind. It’s really a way for the prison-industrial system to benefit off of this cheap source of labor. The companies benefit the most, and so do the Department of Corrections. Like you said, they get paid, they get extra money for room and board where they’re already getting taxpayer money for that. So, they’re getting double. They’re either getting extra fees, whatever else is in the contract, so they’re getting revenue- Eddie Conway: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me just get, you’re saying the state is paying to house the prisoners anyway, and then you’re saying, in addition, the prisoners is paying again for that same housing. Michael Sainato: Yeah. The prisoners are getting taxed twice, because they’re getting taxes out of their income anyways, which goes to things like that, and they’re getting taxed directly for room and board, which is already covered by taxpayer funds. Eddie Conway: What kind of agreements do they have? I noticed in your article you said that a certain amount of prisoners have to be maintained in the Department of Corrections to satisfy the contract of particular companies, and you suggest that’s an expansion of the prison-industrial complex into a slave labor force, or something. I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but talk about that a minute. Michael Sainato: Well, with these contracts, a company like Russell Stover, just for example, we’ll say we have 50 positions we need filled full time. We need 50 workers every day, consistently. And say there’s 40 other similar contracts. The prison needs to fulfill those contracts to keep up with them, to keep the revenue coming on both sides. So they need those people in prison. If you have 2,000 prisoners tied to prison labor contracts, you can’t go under that number of prisoners, so it’s putting a cap on the minimum amount of people, and that’s based on these labor contracts. It’s not based on any actual rehabilitation or decarceration efforts. It’s antithetical to that, because it’s saying we need people in prison. We need people to stay in prison to fulfill these contracts, to fill these obligations. So it keeps people in prison, essentially, and it offers an incentive for the state Department of Corrections to have people say, “We need people to fulfill these contracts. We need workers to send out to these companies.” These programs are growing, so they want more private companies to get involved with it, things like that. Eddie Conway: You mentioned early on as we were talking about shell companies. So big construction companies or other large companies, they use shell companies to contract with the states and to hire prisoners. What’s the purpose of the shell companies? Is there liabilities involved? Why do they do that? Michael Sainato: Part of it’s liability. And, basically, that’s how a lot of these corporations operate, based on their sectors of whatever they’re producing. They have specific companies, but it really is for that lack of liability, the overt transparency. So if you have a public company that has to publicize what they’re doing, they can use one of these shell companies, so they don’t really have to report on, oh, these are the products that are getting made by prison labor. You don’t see any corporation … You’re not going to see a logo on Russell Stover candy, made by prison labor. Companies want to hide that. That’s not something they want to promote. In the cases I covered in my story, these are corporate executives, or just cases that have happened to gauge public interest, because it came apart, all of a sudden, they don’t want this known. They don’t want to publicize that. It’s not something that’s getting them good PR. Eddie Conway: Is there health insurance involved, or are there other benefits? Because I spent a tremendous amount of time in prison, and when I got out, I discovered, unfortunately, that I wasn’t even eligible for social security. I came out at an age that was eligible for social security, but I had none. Are there benefits or liabilities to prisoners in terms of their health, or falling down or getting hurt, or any of this stuff? Or what’s happening about that? Michael Sainato: There’s no OSHA protections for prisoners. If you get hurt on the job, there’s no specific safety protections by law that the rest of the population is provided with. In addition, a lot of these programs, some of them do hire prisoners once they get released, but a lot of them don’t. So how does that help that individual in the long term? We already discussed a lot of the income that these prisoners do receive. It goes to different debts, commissary costs, which are increasing; prison phone calls, incredibly expensive almost everywhere in the US. The prison-industrial complex is getting this money back in all sorts of different ways. When these individuals get out, they’re often not given the job, and a lot of viral stories have come across this. In California, you have prison labor being used to fight fires, but when those individuals get out, they’re not eligible because of the check box that you have to put on job applications. And that’s a big deterrent to employment, and something that a lot of organizations are pushing–to ban the box, to remove those barriers for people getting out of prison, to be able to find work. Or in cases like I talked about, the construction industry in New York City, 24% or 25% of prisoners who are getting jobs out of prison in New York City are working in the construction industry. A lot of these companies are paying these workers poorly in unsafe working conditions and turning them in and spinning them out for projects, and it gets into a really exploitative cycle. And then when these workers that do get hurt, they’re bound to stay within that employment, no matter the conditions, or else they risk being sent back to prison. Eddie Conway: I’ll just point out, this is something just recently happened, because I had been following the firefighters in California and their struggle and the inability to get licensed because of the felony charge. Well, just recently, this is a rare exception. The governor has pardoned the prisoner firefighters, or former prisoner firefighters, so that will allow them to go through that process, but that’s only because the state of California is burning down and prisoners are almost the first line of defense in terms of fighting those fires. That’s a rare, rare exception. What is the public doing? What is the unions doing? This is impacting the workers, the drivers, the construction workers. What are they doing about demanding a fair wage for prisoners, so as not to undercut their wages and ability? Are they doing anything? Michael Sainato: Well, in New York City, the construction union, LIUNA, is pushing for the city council to instill regulations on this industry. They’re called body shops because of how they operate to reign it in and provide these workers with protections and ensure that there are a basis for wages and eventually getting them into union represented jobs. The construction industry is one where they had labor shortages, so-called, before the pandemic even started. That’s in part because you have a lot of firms and companies trying to drive down wages, but it’s very physically demanding, dangerous work, to work in construction, obviously. Few people are going to want to do that for $15, $16 an hour when they have a lot of different options for other jobs where they’re not working in construction. These body shops target people coming out of prison, work release programs, they have with New York City Department of Corrections to get workers, constantly. There’s a website they have, LIUNA, it’s called Justice for Re-entry, and they have a lot of testimonials about prisoners. There’s videos and stories about those people, and the focus is really a justice for re-entry. Creating good jobs, good union jobs with benefits, getting these prisoners into training programs, and actually looking out for their wellbeing rather than just leaving it up to these companies to make money off their backs. Eddie Conway: While you were saying that I was thinking–I knew several prisoners that were excellent carpenters. They did all the qualifications to 5,000 hours of apprenticeship, and they were making fantastic equipment. Desks, tables, chairs, stuff that the state would use. And they were like model prisoners, and year after year, I watched them go up for parole and get turned down, and they had no violations, no nothing, and they just couldn’t figure it out. And, of course, I had figured it out already that they were valuable and their expertise were needed, and so they were actually held in prison longer than they should have been because of the diligence and the skill level that they had in their work. What should the public be doing? Prisoners are, to a great degree, we … I keep saying, “We.” They can’t help their self, in terms of what they accept sometimes, that looks like benefits. What should the public be doing, or what can the public be doing? And I heard you talk about the testimonials, but what can the public do to break this trend in the prison-industrial complex before it becomes locked in cement, so to speak? Michael Sainato: Well, they need to be pushing Congress to give these workers protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act, under The National Labor Relations Act, under OSHA, so that you don’t have people in prison doing work for 40 cents an hour. I think that’s an immoral abomination, and I think a lot of states and the system gets away with it because of lack of transparency. People don’t really understand it. Even in civil detention, immigrants are owned by these private companies, Core Civic and Geo Group, are forced to basically work, even though they’re in holding, not committed of a crime. This is a multi-billion dollar business. A lot of people are making a lot of money off of it and don’t want it changed, and want to keep it hidden. I think the efforts need to be made to stop companies. I live in Florida, where it’s a big issue, and at the University of Florida, there’s been a big organizing effort among students to end prison labor that the school uses for construction gigs around the area, and for food service at the school, in their new contract. I think those are efforts, but I think like you said, where does that leave the people in prison who benefit from having some sort of work or some sort of income? I think it really comes down to pushing for prisoners to be able to have those rights that everyone else does in terms of the minimum wage worker protections, things like that, that they’re exempt for. In 1993, the courts decided that Congress has the authority to decide whether or not prisoners have those rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act. And it’s Congress that needs to act, and there’s things that people can do at the local level. Like I said, getting involved in campaigns and ending prison labor, and pushing for funding and growing programs that help justice for re-entry programs. Programs that actually serve the best interests of prisoners rather than are controlled by a private corporation with state Department of Corrections, that’s for their benefit. Eddie Conway: All right. Thank you for joining me, Michael. Michael Sainato: Thank you, Eddie. It was a pleasure. Eddie Conway: OK. And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. For months, business owners and corporate media pundits in the US have complained about a “labor shortage,” claiming that businesses are struggling to find new employees because “no one wants to work.” Rather than enticing applicants with more competitive wages and stronger benefits and protections, though, many businesses are opting to exploit prison slave labor. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, TRNN Executive Producer Eddie Conway speaks with Michael Sainato about his recent report for The Guardian, which details how bosses in the US are exploiting prison labor to maximize profits and avoid paying workers fair wages. Michael Sainato is an investigative reporter and a regular contributor for The Guardian; his work has been featured in outlets like Vice, The Nation, and the Miami Times. \n",

      " Author: Eddie Conway \n",
      " Date: 2021-07-26 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. The prison industrial complex gets money from people, the poorest people in the nation. It gets billions and billions of dollars. One of the things that sticks out the most is the amount of money taken by multinational phone call systems that work with prisons and the state governments. And something tremendous just happened recently in Connecticut. Connecticut passed a law, and the governor signed it, making phone calls free for families between families and prisoners. Joining me today is Dr. Venezia Michalsen who is an associate professor who worked on this campaign, and she’s going to walk us through this and tell us what happened, why it happened and why it’s important. Dr. Venezia, thanks for joining me. Venezia Michalsen: Thank you so much for having me today. Eddie Conway: We could start off by maybe you talking about why the cost of phone calls is such an important factor in what happens to prisoners and their families. Venezia Michalsen:  Absolutely. You know, we could be here all day talking about that. You have to think about it in terms of the people who are on the outside, the families who are supporting their loved ones who are on the inside. They have to pay these inordinate costs to just keep in contact with their loved ones. People often say, “Well, I don’t want the taxpayers paying for these phone calls.” Except the taxpayers are already paying for these phone calls. Overwhelmingly, they are women, they are mothers, they are grandmothers who are holding it down on the outside, often taking care of children. And they’re the ones that are paying the cost for the phone calls on the outside so that people who are on the inside can stay connected to their families and to their communities. Now, as you know better than I do, people on the inside need that tie to the community, need that tie to their families so that they can both plan for their inevitable, for almost everyone, their inevitable return to the community, and maintain those ties that will remain when they come out and will be the bedrock of their re-entry. But also so that they can reduce their stress while they’re inside. We know that connecting people to their families, whether it’s through visits or through emails on these tablets that are being given out now, or whether it’s phone calls, we know that those not only do they reduce infractions while people are inside, but they also reduce recidivism while people are coming out after they’ve reentered. Eddie Conway: Okay. And of course, I’ve experienced that for decades myself and I can testify that the phone system is a lifeline to not only your family, but to keep violence down inside the prison. Because a lot of times prisoners are frustrated, they’re angry, and they need somebody to talk to. They can’t talk to anybody. They talk to their family, their families talk them down, or they get a chance to talk to their children and they talk their self down. So it’s very important. Had a campaign like this been organized anywhere else in the United States for free phone calls? Venezia Michalsen: You know, Connecticut, I’m very proud to say that I and, but even more than me, my team members. I’d just like to name them quickly, Bianca Tylac, who’s the director and founder of Worth Rises, Diane Lewis with Voices of Women of Color, whose son was incarcerated for many years and she had to talk to her son in the dark because she couldn’t pay the light bill, or she chose to pay the phone bill before the light bill. And then J.O. Richardson, who himself was incarcerated for many years. We’ve fought together with a number of other people for free phone calls in Connecticut as the first state in the nation to have free phone calls. But before us, New York City in its jails has free phone calls and also a few cities in California, San Diego, San Francisco, but there are also a number of states now if people are interested in fighting for free phone calls, we should be fighting for it in every state and federally obviously. But Massachusetts has a campaign that’s pretty active. Michigan, Louisiana. Miami’s got one. So there are a number of places that are fighting for free phone calls around the country. And activists are ready to make this happen all over the country. And then once we’ve got phone calls, then we’re coming for everything else. All of these other places where the prison industrial complex is bleeding our communities, particularly our black and brown communities, and particularly women within those communities, where the prison industrial complex is bleeding those communities dry. We’re ready to come for that next. Eddie Conway: Yeah. One of the things that that struck me was that in Connecticut phone calls costs 10 times more than other states. There’s no regulation across the board for phone calls, because that seems like exorbitant? Venezia Michalsen: It was. We got to a place where it was almost 33 cents a minute for a phone call. We were 49th in the nation. And then during COVID, we dropped to 50th, which, as you say, when people are on the inside and they’re stressed out, they need their families. And COVID made that even worse. People worried about getting sick. People were worried about their families getting sick. They were isolated because visits were stopped. So that we got to a place where it was even more imperative that people got to connect with their families and with people on the outside, and Connecticut maintained that lack of affordability. But at the end of the day, there were kickbacks going to the state. We had a 68% commission going to the state of Connecticut and then Securus on top of that was making 10 cents a minute off of these calls. So what’s the incentive to stop them? But what happened here in Connecticut is tireless, tireless advocates who spent countless hours talking to legislators, turning legislators over. We had people from both sides of the aisle who were looking at this and saying, “This is wrong.” And this was a bipartisan. The bill passed in a very bipartisan way because people finally heard the voices of directly impacted people and said, “This is wrong. We have to change this. We cannot be making money off of the backs of our most disadvantaged people.” Eddie Conway: Just for the public’s sake, what kind of money is involved nationally in these prison phone calls? Venezia Michalsen: I mean, this is a multi-million dollar business. The man who runs Securus is Tom Gores, who owns the Pistons. And not only that, but these are businesses that are in all of our… You know our 401ks, our investments, everybody’s got a toe in these profits and what we need to do, and what an organization like Worth Rises is doing, is finding ways to move towards starving the prison industrial complex out. How do we make it so that they cannot make money any more off of caging people and so they will look towards somewhere else to make that money. But it’s absolutely a multi-million dollar business. The same as with food services, the same is with commissary. All of these ways, sheets and architects, all of these ways in which the prison industrial complex makes money off of caging people, in particular black and brown people. Venezia Michalsen: So how across the nation can other people and other prison rights advocates get involved? So a way for people to get involved is connecting families. If you go to the Worth Rises website, you can see there are a number of campaigns. If someone is interested, they can go into either, if their state… You know, somebody in Louisiana, for example, or Massachusetts, they can connect immediately with advocates who are already fighting this fight with bills in those states, or in some cities like Miami. And if there isn’t currently a campaign, then they can contact Worth Rises to get more information about how to start the fight in their state or in their city. Because it’s absolutely time. If we went, in Connecticut, from 50th, from last place in the nation, to the first in the nation to be free, then anyone can do it. Eddie Conway: Yeah. That’s amazing. I get this all the time, people in the public, conservatives, even church people, et cetera, “Well, prisons are not supposed to be comfortable. Prisons are supposed to be where you punish people at and so why should we be making their life any better?” And I think early on when you first talked about it, you touched on it a little bit, but talk a little more about the impact that kind of attitude has on both families, prisoners, and society at large later on in life. Venezia Michalsen: Absolutely. So what I love to say in response to that is that such things as prison phone calls, or making commissary more affordable, or paying people for their labor, unionizing people who are incarcerated. I know that’s something that you worked on where prison labor happens, making it so that they’re actually making a minimum or living wage. All of these things, they may make people uncomfortable. They don’t make me uncomfortable, they probably don’t you uncomfortable, but they make a lot of people uncomfortable. But to me, the point is that its a win, win, win, win, win across the board. It’s good for the incarcerated people because they’re able to make a plan for their re-entry to society. And as I say, almost everyone that to prison is going to come back into the community. So you’ve got to stay connected to people. You have to make it so that while you’re inside dealing with inhumane circumstances, you’re able to cope and stay connected. But it’s not just good for incarcerated people. It’s also good for their families because we’re not making it so that we’re even widening the racial wealth gap. So that black and brown women on the outside are even poorer because corporations are bleeding them dry. So if we cut that out, it’s even better for them. It’s also better for children because when children can remain connected to their family members, no matter whether their family members have made mistakes or not, they still are better for their children when their children are able to stay connected to them. It has better effects on them educationally, emotionally, academically, all of these different… Physically, all of these different ways it’s better for children when they can stay in touch with their loved ones. So children, families, incarcerated people, but even if you’re conservative in such a way that you’re worried about CO’s and you’re worried about tax payers, it’s still better for them as well. If you’ve got a correctional officer working in a facility and you’ve got the people that you’re working with who are caged there, who are more able to cope, who are less stressed out, who are engaged less in infractions, your job is better. And let’s be honest, CO’s on the outside have astronomical rates of domestic violence, of substance abuse, of suicide, all of these different things because prisons are not humane and they are not places where we should have anyone, whether they’re working there or caged there. And then lastly, when it comes to taxpayers, would you rather pay a little bit upfront or pay a whole lot later. When we’re talking about connecting people to their families, if we’re able to connect them with their families, recidivism rates absolutely plummet, whether it’s phone calls or visits or whatever it is. Recidivism rates plummet. And if we’re paying for jails, hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, per person, or in prisons, tens of thousands of dollars per year per person, if I only cared about my tax dollars, I would much prefer that someone get released and then stay outside, get a job where they can become a taxpayer themselves, go back to their families so that their kids can excel in school and do better, than have them caged on the taxpayer’s dollars. So even though people may feel uncomfortable in a way that is sort of related to blood thirst, if you’re really concerned about humanity, then connecting people with their families and frankly not caging people in the first place is in the best interest of absolutely everyone. Eddie Conway: Okay. So now that brings me to the point you said earlier that a billionaire up in Detroit was gaining obviously from people missing their meals or electricity on the ground. Who’s the major players in this telephone network across the country. It’s like three or four major systems. Who are they? Venezia Michalsen:  It’s very few organizations. Securus, which was related to JPay. You know, I’ve got JPay on my phone so that if I want to send money to somebody who’s inside, that’s how I can do it, and they’ve sort of got a corner on that market. And in Connecticut, Securus is the one that has the corner on that and through most of the country. Eddie Conway: Okay. All right. I know it’s part of the prison industrial complex itself, but it’s the state in Connecticut, obviously the state was benefiting from it and showed no interest in not getting that profit. Is states across the country- Venezia Michalsen: Well. Eddie Conway: Okay, talk to me about that a little bit. Venezia Michalsen:  You know, it depends state by state. So in Connecticut, for example, they were getting a 68% commission, but you know other states are getting far, far less commission. But they certainly are getting a commission off of this. And one of the reasons that we weren’t able to pass this bill last year was because people were worried about how we were going to pay for the things that the kickbacks from phone calls we’re paying for. So that was the major hurdle was, “Well, how are we going to make the money?” And ironically, the kickbacks were paying for probation programs, so it was sort of this odd cycle where communities were even paying for the community supervision of their own family members. But you got to find that money somewhere else. Eddie Conway: Okay. So talk a little bit about where this campaign needs to go next. Okay, I understand it’s like October 2022. October the first, it will be in place for juveniles I believe, and the 22nd it will be in place for adult prisons. Where does this campaign go now beyond this? Venezia Michalsen:  Obviously we want to spread this throughout the country. We’d like phone calls to be free everywhere. But then in terms of what we fight for next, there’s all of these places where we can starve the prison industrial complex of its profits. We can fight for commissary to not have these exorbitant fees attached to it. There’s so many things. Fighting for the decriminalization of sex work, for example. In Connecticut, we also just had marijuana become legalized and that’s something that should be happening around the country. At the end of the day, the point is, how can we empty our prisons? Not only do they not work as so-called correctional facilities, but they are counterproductive in every which way. They do not work. They are bad for everyone. So how can we empty out our prisons? And then also in the meantime, how can we facilitate that emptying by starving it of its profits? There’s so many millions of ways that people are making money off of it. The DMV, for example. You’ve got people who are on the inside who are getting paid pennies an hour to answer phones for the DMV, for example. It’s unconscionable. So how can we sort of move forward in emptying our prisons in that way by making it not profitable anymore? Eddie Conway: Okay. So if you had anything to say to the public, like final words, especially for those… And I like the fact that one of your team members is like a mother. I kind of like watched her talk. I watched some of the interview and the poverty of most prisoners, I mean, most prisoners are in prison because of probably the need to get money or for something. A small percentage is for passion and so on, but most people are in marijuana or drugs or whatever. And so these are the most impoverished people and then they in turn impoverish their families. And it’s a hardship for the family members to organize and have time to do stuff. So if you could talk a minute about what they can do from whatever position they’re in economically, that would probably help. Venezia Michalsen:  Yeah. For me, my greatest honor is to be able to be connected to directly impacted people in the community, whether they’re formerly incarcerated people or whether there are people who have family members incarcerated. I think really most of all, what I’ve learned in my life, is that every tiny little bit counts. So even if you’re just liking something on Facebook or following something on Twitter, so that you can just be a little bit more informed every day and talk to people every day. It’s about showing the humanity of people on the inside and people who are supporting their loved ones on the outside. And once we all recognize that we’re all in this together and that caging people doesn’t do anything at all, then slowly those tiny little steps that no step is too small and then just making that connection, making that friend, subscribing to that newsletter, that all of us collectively together can really make that change over time. I believe that very strongly. Eddie Conway: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. That’s good information and continue to keep up the good work. Venezia Michalsen: Thank you so much. I very much appreciate you having me on today. Eddie Conway: Okay. And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. After Gov. Ned Lamont signed a new bill into law in June, Connecticut became the first state in the US to make phone calls free for incarcerated people, including those in juvenile detention facilities. Studies show that having access to phone calls reduces violence in prisons and prisoner recidivism rates, so why have prisons and private companies been allowed to charge such exorbitant prices for communications between incarcerated people and the outside world? In this week’s episode of Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway speaks with Dr. Venezia Michalsen about why Connecticut’s new law is so significant and why other states should follow suit. Dr. Michalsen is associate professor of Justice Studies at Montclair State University and author of the book Mothering and Desistance in Re-Entry. \n",

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. The prison industrial complex gets money from people, the poorest people in the nation. It gets billions and billions of dollars. One of the things that sticks out the most is the amount of money taken by multinational phone call systems that work with prisons and the state governments. And something tremendous just happened recently in Connecticut. Connecticut passed a law, and the governor signed it, making phone calls free for families between families and prisoners. Joining me today is Dr. Venezia Michalsen who is an associate professor who worked on this campaign, and she’s going to walk us through this and tell us what happened, why it happened and why it’s important. Dr. Venezia, thanks for joining me. Venezia Michalsen: Thank you so much for having me today. Eddie Conway: We could start off by maybe you talking about why the cost of phone calls is such an important factor in what happens to prisoners and their families. Venezia Michalsen:  Absolutely. You know, we could be here all day talking about that. You have to think about it in terms of the people who are on the outside, the families who are supporting their loved ones who are on the inside. They have to pay these inordinate costs to just keep in contact with their loved ones. People often say, “Well, I don’t want the taxpayers paying for these phone calls.” Except the taxpayers are already paying for these phone calls. Overwhelmingly, they are women, they are mothers, they are grandmothers who are holding it down on the outside, often taking care of children. And they’re the ones that are paying the cost for the phone calls on the outside so that people who are on the inside can stay connected to their families and to their communities. Now, as you know better than I do, people on the inside need that tie to the community, need that tie to their families so that they can both plan for their inevitable, for almost everyone, their inevitable return to the community, and maintain those ties that will remain when they come out and will be the bedrock of their re-entry. But also so that they can reduce their stress while they’re inside. We know that connecting people to their families, whether it’s through visits or through emails on these tablets that are being given out now, or whether it’s phone calls, we know that those not only do they reduce infractions while people are inside, but they also reduce recidivism while people are coming out after they’ve reentered. Eddie Conway: Okay. And of course, I’ve experienced that for decades myself and I can testify that the phone system is a lifeline to not only your family, but to keep violence down inside the prison. Because a lot of times prisoners are frustrated, they’re angry, and they need somebody to talk to. They can’t talk to anybody. They talk to their family, their families talk them down, or they get a chance to talk to their children and they talk their self down. So it’s very important. Had a campaign like this been organized anywhere else in the United States for free phone calls? Venezia Michalsen: You know, Connecticut, I’m very proud to say that I and, but even more than me, my team members. I’d just like to name them quickly, Bianca Tylac, who’s the director and founder of Worth Rises, Diane Lewis with Voices of Women of Color, whose son was incarcerated for many years and she had to talk to her son in the dark because she couldn’t pay the light bill, or she chose to pay the phone bill before the light bill. And then J.O. Richardson, who himself was incarcerated for many years. We’ve fought together with a number of other people for free phone calls in Connecticut as the first state in the nation to have free phone calls. But before us, New York City in its jails has free phone calls and also a few cities in California, San Diego, San Francisco, but there are also a number of states now if people are interested in fighting for free phone calls, we should be fighting for it in every state and federally obviously. But Massachusetts has a campaign that’s pretty active. Michigan, Louisiana. Miami’s got one. So there are a number of places that are fighting for free phone calls around the country. And activists are ready to make this happen all over the country. And then once we’ve got phone calls, then we’re coming for everything else. All of these other places where the prison industrial complex is bleeding our communities, particularly our black and brown communities, and particularly women within those communities, where the prison industrial complex is bleeding those communities dry. We’re ready to come for that next. Eddie Conway: Yeah. One of the things that that struck me was that in Connecticut phone calls costs 10 times more than other states. There’s no regulation across the board for phone calls, because that seems like exorbitant? Venezia Michalsen: It was. We got to a place where it was almost 33 cents a minute for a phone call. We were 49th in the nation. And then during COVID, we dropped to 50th, which, as you say, when people are on the inside and they’re stressed out, they need their families. And COVID made that even worse. People worried about getting sick. People were worried about their families getting sick. They were isolated because visits were stopped. So that we got to a place where it was even more imperative that people got to connect with their families and with people on the outside, and Connecticut maintained that lack of affordability. But at the end of the day, there were kickbacks going to the state. We had a 68% commission going to the state of Connecticut and then Securus on top of that was making 10 cents a minute off of these calls. So what’s the incentive to stop them? But what happened here in Connecticut is tireless, tireless advocates who spent countless hours talking to legislators, turning legislators over. We had people from both sides of the aisle who were looking at this and saying, “This is wrong.” And this was a bipartisan. The bill passed in a very bipartisan way because people finally heard the voices of directly impacted people and said, “This is wrong. We have to change this. We cannot be making money off of the backs of our most disadvantaged people.” Eddie Conway: Just for the public’s sake, what kind of money is involved nationally in these prison phone calls? Venezia Michalsen: I mean, this is a multi-million dollar business. The man who runs Securus is Tom Gores, who owns the Pistons. And not only that, but these are businesses that are in all of our… You know our 401ks, our investments, everybody’s got a toe in these profits and what we need to do, and what an organization like Worth Rises is doing, is finding ways to move towards starving the prison industrial complex out. How do we make it so that they cannot make money any more off of caging people and so they will look towards somewhere else to make that money. But it’s absolutely a multi-million dollar business. The same as with food services, the same is with commissary. All of these ways, sheets and architects, all of these ways in which the prison industrial complex makes money off of caging people, in particular black and brown people. Venezia Michalsen: So how across the nation can other people and other prison rights advocates get involved? So a way for people to get involved is connecting families. If you go to the Worth Rises website, you can see there are a number of campaigns. If someone is interested, they can go into either, if their state… You know, somebody in Louisiana, for example, or Massachusetts, they can connect immediately with advocates who are already fighting this fight with bills in those states, or in some cities like Miami. And if there isn’t currently a campaign, then they can contact Worth Rises to get more information about how to start the fight in their state or in their city. Because it’s absolutely time. If we went, in Connecticut, from 50th, from last place in the nation, to the first in the nation to be free, then anyone can do it. Eddie Conway: Yeah. That’s amazing. I get this all the time, people in the public, conservatives, even church people, et cetera, “Well, prisons are not supposed to be comfortable. Prisons are supposed to be where you punish people at and so why should we be making their life any better?” And I think early on when you first talked about it, you touched on it a little bit, but talk a little more about the impact that kind of attitude has on both families, prisoners, and society at large later on in life. Venezia Michalsen: Absolutely. So what I love to say in response to that is that such things as prison phone calls, or making commissary more affordable, or paying people for their labor, unionizing people who are incarcerated. I know that’s something that you worked on where prison labor happens, making it so that they’re actually making a minimum or living wage. All of these things, they may make people uncomfortable. They don’t make me uncomfortable, they probably don’t you uncomfortable, but they make a lot of people uncomfortable. But to me, the point is that its a win, win, win, win, win across the board. It’s good for the incarcerated people because they’re able to make a plan for their re-entry to society. And as I say, almost everyone that to prison is going to come back into the community. So you’ve got to stay connected to people. You have to make it so that while you’re inside dealing with inhumane circumstances, you’re able to cope and stay connected. But it’s not just good for incarcerated people. It’s also good for their families because we’re not making it so that we’re even widening the racial wealth gap. So that black and brown women on the outside are even poorer because corporations are bleeding them dry. So if we cut that out, it’s even better for them. It’s also better for children because when children can remain connected to their family members, no matter whether their family members have made mistakes or not, they still are better for their children when their children are able to stay connected to them. It has better effects on them educationally, emotionally, academically, all of these different… Physically, all of these different ways it’s better for children when they can stay in touch with their loved ones. So children, families, incarcerated people, but even if you’re conservative in such a way that you’re worried about CO’s and you’re worried about tax payers, it’s still better for them as well. If you’ve got a correctional officer working in a facility and you’ve got the people that you’re working with who are caged there, who are more able to cope, who are less stressed out, who are engaged less in infractions, your job is better. And let’s be honest, CO’s on the outside have astronomical rates of domestic violence, of substance abuse, of suicide, all of these different things because prisons are not humane and they are not places where we should have anyone, whether they’re working there or caged there. And then lastly, when it comes to taxpayers, would you rather pay a little bit upfront or pay a whole lot later. When we’re talking about connecting people to their families, if we’re able to connect them with their families, recidivism rates absolutely plummet, whether it’s phone calls or visits or whatever it is. Recidivism rates plummet. And if we’re paying for jails, hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, per person, or in prisons, tens of thousands of dollars per year per person, if I only cared about my tax dollars, I would much prefer that someone get released and then stay outside, get a job where they can become a taxpayer themselves, go back to their families so that their kids can excel in school and do better, than have them caged on the taxpayer’s dollars. So even though people may feel uncomfortable in a way that is sort of related to blood thirst, if you’re really concerned about humanity, then connecting people with their families and frankly not caging people in the first place is in the best interest of absolutely everyone. Eddie Conway: Okay. So now that brings me to the point you said earlier that a billionaire up in Detroit was gaining obviously from people missing their meals or electricity on the ground. Who’s the major players in this telephone network across the country. It’s like three or four major systems. Who are they? Venezia Michalsen:  It’s very few organizations. Securus, which was related to JPay. You know, I’ve got JPay on my phone so that if I want to send money to somebody who’s inside, that’s how I can do it, and they’ve sort of got a corner on that market. And in Connecticut, Securus is the one that has the corner on that and through most of the country. Eddie Conway: Okay. All right. I know it’s part of the prison industrial complex itself, but it’s the state in Connecticut, obviously the state was benefiting from it and showed no interest in not getting that profit.

Over the past few weeks, Battleground Baltimore has covered the fight to save the Cherry Hill Urban Community Garden—the only source of fresh food in a neighborhood experiencing food apartheid and historic disinvestment—from eviction by the City Housing Authority. We’ve spoken to the last residents of the West Baltimore Poppleton neighborhood who want to save their historic homes from demolition by an out-of-town developer—who has now threatened residents with a lawsuit if they continue to publicly oppose the project (we’ll have an update from Poppleton later in the newsletter).

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham ,and welcome to Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individuals. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to achieve this goal by focusing on how the investigative work of cop watchers has been ignored and even blocked by the purveyors of copaganda, and what this disturbing pattern says about the efforts of citizen journalists to hold police accountable. And I’m very pleased to say we speak with Laura Shark, Tom Zebra, and Dale Lackluster to illustrate this point. But before I get started, I want those watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at PAR@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us. And we now have a Patreon account called Police Accountability Reports. So if you have a few dollars to spare, it would really help us keep doing these investigations for you–investigations the mainstream media simply won’t do. So please check for the link pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve got all that out of the way. Now, we continue to highlight on this show the work of cop watchers and auditors, citizen journalists who go out day after day to attempt to hold police and the government accountable. It’s a phenomenon that has been growing consistently over the past decade, and continues to uncover police misconduct and government malfeasance, all based upon the use of cell phone cameras and YouTube channels and, of course, of participation of viewers like you. That’s why when we received the call from a popular cop watcher named Laura Shark, we immediately jumped on the story. Turns out that some very important work she had done was at the risk of being appropriated by the mainstream media without acknowledging her role in obtaining it. And it’s how this happened and the implications of this misuse we will unpack today. And she’s not the only cop watcher who suffered at the hands of mainstream media. We will also be talking to Dale Lackluster, a cop watcher and respected auditor whose report on this public body camera footage was subject to a copyright strike on YouTube. That’s right, a video created by our tax dollars was claimed by corporate media as their property in an effort to suppress free and fair citizen reporting. But first, let me start with this story of what happened to Laura Shark. Shark, along with her reporting partner Tom Zebra, has been a tireless cop watcher for years. Her work in the Los Angeles area documenting police malfeasance has been unflinching. In fact, her reporting has been so effective that she was brought into questioning by internal affairs investigators over this brutal beating that she caught on camera. The victim was driving home from work when he was stopped by the police. Soon, he was dragged out of his car and then this, a brutal beatdown that Laura captured on camera. Let’s watch the footage. And just a warning to viewers, what you’re about to see is very disturbing. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Interviewer: Okay, and is there anything else? Laura Shark: Well, what else would you like to know? Interviewer: I guess I just wanted a little more detail about whether he had a weapon or anything, or what were the circumstances that led to that brutality? Laura Shark: I just know that at this time it said it was a traffic detention for a vehicle [inaudible]. The situation escalated into one where he became combative with deputies and deputies had to subdue him. [END VIDEO CLIP] Taya Graham: Now, for months, despite her efforts to find out the fate of the victim and even his name, Laura was stonewalled by the police. Meanwhile, as we said before, the department eventually dragged her in for questioning as part of their internal affairs investigation into allegations of police brutality. But what happened next shows not just the importance of cop watchers like Laura, but what an uphill battle they face combating the power of the corporate media–a struggle best exemplified by how the media elites used her work as fodder for their product without acknowledging her role in exposing questionable actions by the police. That’s because when the lawyer for the man is seen in this video asks Laura to turn over her footage as evidence, she was happy to oblige, but that favor turned out to have unforeseen consequences. That’s because one day Laura was scrolling through YouTube when she saw this: her video being used without attribution by MSNBC, a major network news channel and a billion-dollar corporation. Now, it’s important to note why this lack of acknowledgement by corporate behemoths who make billions on news operations is indicative of a larger problem. It’s not just a matter of hurting her feelings or simply making an honest mistake. And for more on what’s really going on here, and before I speak to Laura, I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Thanks for having me, I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve worked for some pretty large corporate media outlets, but you also had your own website. What did you learn that’s applicable to Laura’s experience? Stephen Janis: Well, in the media ecosystem, capitalism is applicable. If I use someone’s story, I would get sued or they would threaten me, but they were free to use any content that I made and I had no recourse. And an interesting thought about this is that, if there’s a documentary filmmaker, which we are, if we want to use a clip from 20 years ago from a TV station, they’ll charge us $2,500, $3,000 for 30 seconds. If they wanted to take stories off my website or use stuff that I did, no problem, you have no recourse. So it’s a really unfair system, but very similar to how capitalism works. Taya Graham: What do you think would have happened, say had the shoe been on the other foot, and Laura had taken their footage and not giving them credit? Stephen Janis: I think quite clearly that if, in the case of Laura, if she used video from a television station or a network, they would have not just copyright strike it, but probably would have sued her or had a corporate lawyer call her, which is what they do. So I think basically the reciprocal–sort of, I can use yours, you can use mine–does not exist. And I think the respect that auditors deserve as journalists is not there, and that’s something that has to change. Taya Graham: Now, I’m going to go back to Stephen a little bit later in the show, but first I want to talk to Laura herself and have her tell us how she feels about what happened to her reporting and how she was treated, and what it means for citizen journalists like herself. Laura, thank you so much for joining me. Laura Shark: Hi, it’s great to be back. Taya Graham: So, Laura, first, just talk about the brutal beatdown that you captured on camera, what happened, and what you documented. Laura Shark: What happened–it’s funny, I know I’m hesitating because for a year he was a nameless man. Basically he was, oh, I remember the guy that was beat by… He was nameless, and it was surreal, it was bittersweet when finally that was found by the lawyer, that she found the video, finally. But what had happened is Chris Bailey was on his way home from work–he works for a contractor, the post office, okay, so for mailing–he was on his way home. And apparently he, according to the sheriff, straddling the lane, which I don’t… Straddling the lane is either BS or it’s like you’re making a… Getting in the next lane without it–and whatever, anyway, it’s not anything that ever would deserve what happened to him basically. So they approached his window, they asked for his license. Like any other man he has it in his wallet, I would assume in his pocket. When he went to get it, they’re like, “Whoa, we don’t know if you have a weapon here, get out of the car.” And so he stepped out of the car, he completely was… Everything they were asking of him, he was doing. He was tired, he wanted to go home. He gets out of the car. And, this is basically my assumption, is that when they went to put handcuffs on him, it startled him and their report it says… What did it say? His elbow… What did it say? Tom Zebra: His elbow moved backwards. Laura Shark: His elbow moved backwards, is in the official report. So I can only assume that he gets out and they immediately handcuff him and it startled him. That’s just me assuming. But anyway, at that point, instantly the deputies attacked him, the two–which was Walker and Groves, Deputy Walker and Deputy Groves. They called for backup. That’s probably around the point that we heard it over the scanner, never mind me seeing–we were actually covering LAPD, but then I see a Sheriff’s vehicle just hightail it down… And so we basically followed and we were listening to the scanner. So at that point, I believe, four more deputies arrived for backup, and several others. But the lawsuit that has now been filed is on six deputies that… In the documents it says that one of them held him in a chokehold while the other ones beat him. He had so much facial… Was it called his orbital…? He has orbital fractures, his eye had literally popped out of the socket momentarily from the pressure of the beatings. They knocked out his teeth, they apparently pulled down his pants and lifted his shirt, tased him in his abdomen and groin area. These are all very extreme. And how do you even explain that these are necessary actions to subdue? Oh, he’s had already three facial reconstruction surgeries, he is basically almost legally blind in his left eye, he will forever be… He is affected for the rest of his life from this incident. There’s just no… Not that you could forget it, but he would never be able to, because he has a physical… He’s only got, like, 60% sight in the eye, he wears a patch to this day. This is a year later. He’s got another surgery already scheduled. This man has been maimed, basically. It’s horrific. Tom Zebra: Every night of the week we see and record these guys. The only thing unique about this case is that hopefully there’s going to be consequences. But we’re not kidding when we say every night of the week we record these guys conducting illegal searches, making unlawful stops. And like Laura just mentioned, they’re being promoted, they’re being rewarded, they’re not being disciplined. Taya Graham: Now, recently you were saying your video was used by some pretty big mainstream media outlets. Can you talk about who used it and how this happened? Laura Shark: I was… When we met, when the lawyer had contacted us and we went and met with her and I turned over all completely all the raw files that had to do with this incident, and I signed over the waiver. So she had every right to do anything she wanted with it. So she is the one, when she did the press release, she had given over a video, I would assume, or something, for the news agencies. Somebody contacted me on Instagram or something, saying, “Your video’s all over the news.” And I was like… And I already knew, mind you, the lawyer did call a month ago to give me a heads up that they’re moving forward with the thing. So I had it in my mind that something was going to happen soon, and at least… Or whatever. I don’t know if I necessarily knew that my video would be shown, but then I look and it was, it was exciting to see things to come to fruition. It’s a bittersweet… It honestly never should have happened, obviously. This never, ever, I would never wish this upon my worst enemy. But I feel like, thank God that she had found me. The agents… Most of the articles and the news called me a bystander with cell phone video, right. So I don’t know if that’s necessarily the lawyer’s fault. She said she called me an angel or something. I think they just put that into their own words. In my mind, I felt like it was a little belittling to claim that it was a cell phone video because it’s like, oh, cell phone videos, somebody just… We were discussing this, Daniel and I, I don’t know why they wouldn’t have… If it was just a common citizen or just somebody walking down the street, they would have never been able to record that the way that Daniel and I have the ability to get into these scenes or these incidents. To be perfectly honest, I just don’t think that anybody could have done what we did, just to be a common bystander. And I just feel when I was, no, no, no, no, no, it was on my camera, we were there very specifically because they were there, and that they do what they did. And then all these news, they never identify deputies, they never name them. And for whatever it’s worth, it’s like–in any incident that you ever see, you never see… Only recently, Vanessa Brian was able to release five deputy names in her lawsuit, but that seemed like a struggle for her. And to be able to have that ability… And she’s known the names. We were told by the lawyer, well, they gave us these pictures of the deputies, we were given a list of the deputy names, but they didn’t connect any names to any faces. So they just did the minimal amount of turnover for them. So I was like, that’s Kano, that’s [inaudible name]. There’s only two deputies it came down to, which is the first two that actually pulled him over, Walker and Groves, that I’m not sure which one is which, because we weren’t familiar with those deputies. Taya Graham: Have you contacted any of these organizations for credit? And why do you think they don’t want to acknowledge your work? Tom Zebra: The story is… This information is finally available. It’s years and years later. These things have been ongoing, finally the story is coming out, and they’re not going to even say the names of the deputies. So the people involved are still on the street for us to record doing this every night, but they’re not even… The story should be related to the people involved. If it was me or Laura committing the crime, the story would have our names, and we would be publicly humiliated or shamed for our actions. It’s not enough to just mention the sheriff department that has 10,000 deputies. The six guys involved need to be named, because that would hopefully discourage them from continuing to do this night after night after night. But the mainstream media is still not going to publish their names. It’s up to us to publish their names. And we don’t have the audience to get that information out there. So what happens is we end up facing retaliation on the street for trying to expose them. Mainstream media protects the police and the police protects the mainstream media. And yeah, that’s what I think. Taya Graham: But Laura is not alone in her battle against mainstream media. In fact, another popular cop watcher found himself on the wrong end of corporate journalism when he had to take down a video because a local television station claimed that they owned the copyright to dashcam footage. That’s right, this footage you see here was claimed by a local television station who filed a copyright strike against this popular channel run by Dale Lackluster. The strike was perplexing, given that the video in question was created with taxpayer dollars by supposedly public servants. The video was obtained by Lackluster through a public records request. And for more on what happened, I’m joined by Dale Lackluster himself. Dale, thank you so much for joining me. Dale Lackluster: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So, first, just give us a sense of why you started this channel. What prompted you to decide to hold police accountable? Dale Lackluster: Well, for a number of years, I was watching a lot of the First Amendment auditing community. And I have a background in public service. I was a combat medic for the infantry, and after that I became a dual function firefighter-paramedic for Los Angeles City Fire Department. So I had a lot of experience working with the LAPD. And I was kind of aligned with them. I guess most people would commonly refer to that as a bootlicker. And so, for a long time, I was of that mindset. And then I got just kind of interested in these various experiences I was seeing in the First Amendment auditing community. And for a number of years I was paying attention to it and getting more and more sucked into it. And one day I had my own experience. And I had actually called the cops to help my neighbor, as he had told a bunch of our friends in a friend group that he was going to commit suicide. And so that interaction went real negative, for me. And luckily I wasn’t arrested or anything, but it just showed me, you see it happen on the screen so much, but when it finally happens to you is the moment that you realize this can happen to anybody. No matter who you are, what your background is, how much time of your… How many years of your life you’ve devoted to public service, they can still just as easily turn on you. So I figured I had to do something. Taya Graham: So what did the police do to you that changed your mind? Dale Lackluster: Well, basically, I was recording from my front doorstep. And I had one foot in my home and one foot out. And I’d been recording them for about a half an hour, because I was very worried about my neighbor. He was actually a good friend of mine, I’d helped him get a job. And so… It was about 30 minutes that I was standing out there recording them. And they finally geared up, and they had their vests, helmets, riot shields, and all that, and they were going to kick the door in. And it was at that moment where one of the officers turned to me and he said, “Go inside.” And I said, no, I’m over a hundred feet away, the houses were at an angle, so I couldn’t even see the front door. And he’s telling me, “You’re going to get arrested if you don’t go inside.” And so I immediately saw that as a violation of my civil rights, my right to record, not to mention I was on my own personal property. So I mean, that was it, it was real simple. Luckily I wasn’t arrested, I wasn’t summoned. A supervisor was called to the scene. There was an internal investigation. They never said what happened to the guy, or anything. But that little tiny experience for me was enough to say, you know, go do something. Taya Graham: What have you learned about policing through your investigations? Dale Lackluster: I guess quite a bit. The channel started off with me actually actively looking for things to report on. And then it slowly turned into something where I’m getting between 50 and 100 emails a day from people who are saying, “This happened to me. Can you check it out?” “Will this fit on your channel?” And realistically, I could probably put up a dozen videos a day, if I had the time to do that. And it takes me six to eight hours per video that I put out to research and produce and edit and publish. I think what that’s taught me is how big of a problem it is. And that’s just me. I know that for a YouTube channel I have a decent amount of subscribers, but the United States doesn’t know about me. Like one tenth of a percent of the population has heard about me. And I’ve got that many people looking to share their experience with me and trying to get it out to the public. And most of them are egregious violations. And a lot of them are cover-ups or have some sort of sense of cover-ups. And not only that, most of the time the experiences or the interactions and encounters are things that we see over and over and over again. Like, the departments aren’t learning, the cops aren’t learning, and they just keep happening and growing. And maybe that’s just a result of my space as a creator in this field, but to me it looks like it’s an ever-expanding and growing problem. Taya Graham: So do you think the auditing community gets the respect it deserves? Do you think people take it seriously? Dale Lackluster: That’s a really good question. I think it gets the respect that it deserves from the people who know they need it. It’s one of those divisive communities; you’re either all in or you’re all against. And I guess there’s even some division within the community with the way people audit. I hear a lot of people make the argument that the cool, calm demeanor is the right way to go–you catch more flies with honey type of thing. And then you have some of the really volatile auditors that start off with vulgarities immediately. And even in that sense, my view on that is I think that law enforcement needs to be exposed to both. They’re going to scenes where people aren’t going to be sugar and honey or milk and honey, and they need to know how to approach those scenes appropriately. So if it’s always clean and sterile, they’re never going to know how to act appropriately on those calls. So I personally see a benefit from both styles of auditing. But as far as just in general, no, I think the back the blue crowd hates the auditing community, and the auditors love it. Taya Graham: Now, you had a mainstream media outlet exercise a copyright strike against you for posting dashcam footage. Can you talk about what happened? Dale Lackluster: Yeah. I don’t know fully what happened as far as why the copyright strike happened. All of the footage that I used in the video was public domain. It was from the Arkansas State Police. I attempted a FOIA request. They denied me, because I’m not an Arkansas resident. I reached out to my viewers. My viewers responded. And one of them actually obtained the bodycam, or the dashcam footage, for me, sent it to me. And I consulted with my lawyers, made sure that’s all legal, and yes, we got the green light. And so once I got that dashcam footage, I made that video. It went crazy viral. And they had made a story about it, too, because it happened in their little local jurisdiction for their local news channel. And I called the news desk and said, Hey, you guys just copyright striked my channel and took down my video, but it’s public domain and that video was actually featured on The Young Turks, DL Hughley re-posted it, and a bunch of other people. But for some reason, the news channel either thought it was theirs or they had a computer system that just automatically identifies videos that could be theirs and just strikes it automatically without any human review, or they did it maliciously to try to stop my video from getting so many views so that their video could get more views. I don’t know, but I’ve consulted with counsel and we are taking it to court. Taya Graham: So just understand, how can body or dashcam footage, which is created basically by public tax dollars, belong to anyone? How is that not public property? Dale Lackluster: It is public property, there’s no doubt about that, it’s never owned by anyone. So either they have a guy in their copyright room that doesn’t understand Section 207 of the Copyright Act and what public domain is, or they did it maliciously, or it was just really an accident. But either way, the video is back up, the strike’s been taken down. Taya Graham: Can you talk about a video that is of particular importance to you? A video that you feel encapsulates what you do. Dale Lackluster: I guess there’s quite a few. I very rarely have a video that gets some sort of . And it’s something that I get a lot of complaints about, actually, on my channels, that they never see the resolutions from these interactions. And that’s because, simply, litigation takes years. Eric Brandt took seven years to litigate one of his cases. And internal affairs and all that stuff take so much time. And settlements sometimes get slapped with gag orders. So my personal favorite ones are… I guess I don’t have a specific one. But there have been quite a few within the past five or six months where we have an immediate reaction from the local police department, where they either shut down their Facebook page, they terminate the officer, some type of suspension. We’ve had a couple that have resulted in settlements within just a couple months after the incident, so those ones would be my favorite, I guess. Taya Graham: Now, I just want to toss back to Stephen, because I know he’s reached out to the television station in question, and I want to hear if he’s heard back. Stephen, thanks for joining me again, and tell me, what have you heard from the station about their copyright strike? Stephen Janis: Well, I sent them an email with a very specific question: How did you claim a copyright on publicly created documents, information, et cetera? And I have yet to hear back, but I’m going to keep pressing them, because I think this is a fundamental question, and is very important to the auditing community and people like us, who are independent, nonprofit-funded journalism. They’re going to answer the question. They haven’t answered yet, but they will. Taya Graham: Now, I know that the battle between the cop watching community and the mainstream media can seem like inside baseball, I’m even aware of the fact that the plight of a cop watcher with a YouTube channel can seem like a diversion from the true focus of the show, which is watching cops and holding them accountable. But please allow me to push back on that idea a little bit, not just to be ornery, but to make a case for what the alternative media really represents and why it is critical to the health of our fledgling democracy. To do so, I’m going to reference a book called Seeing. It’s a fictional novel by an esteemed Spanish writer, José Saramago. And the book tells the tale of a city where very odd and inexplicable thing happens. During an election, most of the residents of the capital city go to the polls, and almost all of them cast blank votes. This is despite actually dropping a ballot in the ballot box. Most of them did not check off a specific candidate. The appearance of the so-called blankers creates confrontation, confusion, and even threats of violence from the political elites. In fact, the ruling class is so confused the entire government abandons the city completely, expecting the community to erupt into chaos. But instead, the opposite occurs, promoting the country’s leadership to resort to even more extreme measures. Now, I don’t want to give away the whole story, but the reason why I bring up this book is because I think it makes a point about what the mainstream media ignores, or, in some cases, even tries to thwart, with cop watchers. Because I think the people who seek alternative media sources like Laura Shark and Lackluster are the contemporary equivalent to blankers: people who refuse to buy into the status quo and seek truth where it can exist without fear or favor. And that’s also why mainstream media hits back: because of fear. Fear that people who choose to assemble and obtain knowledge outside of the purview of the status quo represent a threat to it. That those who don’t turn to the greed infused media for the truth are skeptical of the irrational narratives it espouses. As we discussed last week, the nation’s war on drugs was an utter disaster that did nothing–and I mean nothing–to reduce addiction or the suffering associated with drug use. Just consider the fact that this year the DEA, our huge drug enforcement administration, is spending billions and making thousands of drug possession arrests, but overdose deaths rose to their highest level ever: 90,000 people dead. Now, compare that to the breathless coverage from the mainstream media about the heroic efforts of drug warriors, about the scourge of drug dealing in our dangerous cities, about all the wonderful successes that have led to the largest experiment in mass incarceration in the history of human civilization. And so, like the people in the book Seeing, if we collectively decide that this narrative is simply not worth paying attention to, the corporate media fights back with their rational acts, like using a video without attribution, or copyright striking body camera footage. This is how they fight back when we ignore their offerings and do our own reporting or watch auditors like Laura Shark or Tom Zebra and Lackluster, and this is what happens when we choose to ignore their irrational narratives, seeking to justify that the possession of mind-altering substances should lead to arrest, loss of freedom, and even sometimes loss of our lives. We simply become blankers, and they just can’t stand it, so they try to stop it. Maybe, just maybe, the people we spoke to today are a threat to the insanity that our corporate media counterparts have embraced for years. Maybe journalism for and by the people is the only thing that will save us from the idea that it’s okay for people to get sick and go bankrupt, or for cops to take property without charging people, or making an arrest. Maybe that’s why large corporations either appropriate or block the work of these auditors. But that’s also why we will keep reporting on what they do, and holding the people that want to stop them accountable. I want to thank Laura Shark, Tom Zebra, and Dale Lackluster for their important work and for taking the time to sit down with us and discuss it. Thank you all so much. And, of course, I have to thank intrepid journalist Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing on this piece.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham ,and welcome to Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individuals. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to achieve this goal by focusing on how the investigative work of cop watchers has been ignored and even blocked by the purveyors of copaganda, and what this disturbing pattern says about the efforts of citizen journalists to hold police accountable. And I’m very pleased to say we speak with Laura Shark, Tom Zebra, and Dale Lackluster to illustrate this point. But before I get started, I want those watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at PAR@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And, of course, you can always message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us. And we now have a Patreon account called Police Accountability Reports. So if you have a few dollars to spare, it would really help us keep doing these investigations for you–investigations the mainstream media simply won’t do. So please check for the link pinned in the comments below. Okay, now we’ve got all that out of the way. Now, we continue to highlight on this show the work of cop watchers and auditors, citizen journalists who go out day after day to attempt to hold police and the government accountable. It’s a phenomenon that has been growing consistently over the past decade, and continues to uncover police misconduct and government malfeasance, all based upon the use of cell phone cameras and YouTube channels and, of course, of participation of viewers like you. That’s why when we received the call from a popular cop watcher named Laura Shark, we immediately jumped on the story. Turns out that some very important work she had done was at the risk of being appropriated by the mainstream media without acknowledging her role in obtaining it. And it’s how this happened and the implications of this misuse we will unpack today. And she’s not the only cop watcher who suffered at the hands of mainstream media. We will also be talking to Dale Lackluster, a cop watcher and respected auditor whose report on this public body camera footage was subject to a copyright strike on YouTube. That’s right, a video created by our tax dollars was claimed by corporate media as their property in an effort to suppress free and fair citizen reporting. But first, let me start with this story of what happened to Laura Shark. Shark, along with her reporting partner Tom Zebra, has been a tireless cop watcher for years. Her work in the Los Angeles area documenting police malfeasance has been unflinching. In fact, her reporting has been so effective that she was brought into questioning by internal affairs investigators over this brutal beating that she caught on camera. The victim was driving home from work when he was stopped by the police. Soon, he was dragged out of his car and then this, a brutal beatdown that Laura captured on camera. Let’s watch the footage. And just a warning to viewers, what you’re about to see is very disturbing. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Interviewer: Okay, and is there anything else? Laura Shark: Well, what else would you like to know? Interviewer: I guess I just wanted a little more detail about whether he had a weapon or anything, or what were the circumstances that led to that brutality? Laura Shark: I just know that at this time it said it was a traffic detention for a vehicle [inaudible]. The situation escalated into one where he became combative with deputies and deputies had to subdue him. [END VIDEO CLIP] Taya Graham: Now, for months, despite her efforts to find out the fate of the victim and even his name, Laura was stonewalled by the police. Meanwhile, as we said before, the department eventually dragged her in for questioning as part of their internal affairs investigation into allegations of police brutality. But what happened next shows not just the importance of cop watchers like Laura, but what an uphill battle they face combating the power of the corporate media–a struggle best exemplified by how the media elites used her work as fodder for their product without acknowledging her role in exposing questionable actions by the police. That’s because when the lawyer for the man is seen in this video asks Laura to turn over her footage as evidence, she was happy to oblige, but that favor turned out to have unforeseen consequences. That’s because one day Laura was scrolling through YouTube when she saw this: her video being used without attribution by MSNBC, a major network news channel and a billion-dollar corporation. Now, it’s important to note why this lack of acknowledgement by corporate behemoths who make billions on news operations is indicative of a larger problem. It’s not just a matter of hurting her feelings or simply making an honest mistake. And for more on what’s really going on here, and before I speak to Laura, I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephen, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Thanks for having me, I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, you’ve worked for some pretty large corporate media outlets, but you also had your own website. What did you learn that’s applicable to Laura’s experience? Stephen Janis: Well, in the media ecosystem, capitalism is applicable. If I use someone’s story, I would get sued or they would threaten me, but they were free to use any content that I made and I had no recourse. And an interesting thought about this is that, if there’s a documentary filmmaker, which we are, if we want to use a clip from 20 years ago from a TV station, they’ll charge us $2,500, $3,000 for 30 seconds. If they wanted to take stories off my website or use stuff that I did, no problem, you have no recourse. So it’s a really unfair system, but very similar to how capitalism works. Taya Graham: What do you think would have happened, say had the shoe been on the other foot, and Laura had taken their footage and not giving them credit? Stephen Janis: I think quite clearly that if, in the case of Laura, if she used video from a television station or a network, they would have not just copyright strike it, but probably would have sued her or had a corporate lawyer call her, which is what they do. So I think basically the reciprocal–sort of, I can use yours, you can use mine–does not exist. And I think the respect that auditors deserve as journalists is not there, and that’s something that has to change. Taya Graham: Now, I’m going to go back to Stephen a little bit later in the show, but first I want to talk to Laura herself and have her tell us how she feels about what happened to her reporting and how she was treated, and what it means for citizen journalists like herself. Laura, thank you so much for joining me. Laura Shark: Hi, it’s great to be back. Taya Graham: So, Laura, first, just talk about the brutal beatdown that you captured on camera, what happened, and what you documented. Laura Shark: What happened–it’s funny, I know I’m hesitating because for a year he was a nameless man. Basically he was, oh, I remember the guy that was beat by… He was nameless, and it was surreal, it was bittersweet when finally that was found by the lawyer, that she found the video, finally. But what had happened is Chris Bailey was on his way home from work–he works for a contractor, the post office, okay, so for mailing–he was on his way home. And apparently he, according to the sheriff, straddling the lane, which I don’t… Straddling the lane is either BS or it’s like you’re making a… Getting in the next lane without it–and whatever, anyway, it’s not anything that ever would deserve what happened to him basically. So they approached his window, they asked for his license. Like any other man he has it in his wallet, I would assume in his pocket. When he went to get it, they’re like, “Whoa, we don’t know if you have a weapon here, get out of the car.” And so he stepped out of the car, he completely was… Everything they were asking of him, he was doing. He was tired, he wanted to go home. He gets out of the car. And, this is basically my assumption, is that when they went to put handcuffs on him, it startled him and their report it says… What did it say? His elbow… What did it say? Tom Zebra: His elbow moved backwards. Laura Shark: His elbow moved backwards, is in the official report. So I can only assume that he gets out and they immediately handcuff him and it startled him. That’s just me assuming. But anyway, at that point, instantly the deputies attacked him, the two–which was Walker and Groves, Deputy Walker and Deputy Groves. They called for backup. That’s probably around the point that we heard it over the scanner, never mind me seeing–we were actually covering LAPD, but then I see a Sheriff’s vehicle just hightail it down… And so we basically followed and we were listening to the scanner. So at that point, I believe, four more deputies arrived for backup, and several others. But the lawsuit that has now been filed is on six deputies that… In the documents it says that one of them held him in a chokehold while the other ones beat him. He had so much facial… Was it called his orbital…? He has orbital fractures, his eye had literally popped out of the socket momentarily from the pressure of the beatings. They knocked out his teeth, they apparently pulled down his pants and lifted his shirt, tased him in his abdomen and groin area. These are all very extreme. And how do you even explain that these are necessary actions to subdue? Oh, he’s had already three facial reconstruction surgeries, he is basically almost legally blind in his left eye, he will forever be… He is affected for the rest of his life from this incident. There’s just no… Not that you could forget it, but he would never be able to, because he has a physical… He’s only got, like, 60% sight in the eye, he wears a patch to this day. This is a year later. He’s got another surgery already scheduled. This man has been maimed, basically. It’s horrific. Tom Zebra: Every night of the week we see and record these guys. The only thing unique about this case is that hopefully there’s going to be consequences. But we’re not kidding when we say every night of the week we record these guys conducting illegal searches, making unlawful stops. And like Laura just mentioned, they’re being promoted, they’re being rewarded, they’re not being disciplined. Taya Graham: Now, recently you were saying your video was used by some pretty big mainstream media outlets. Can you talk about who used it and how this happened? Laura Shark: I was… When we met, when the lawyer had contacted us and we went and met with her and I turned over all completely all the raw files that had to do with this incident, and I signed over the waiver. So she had every right to do anything she wanted with it. So she is the one, when she did the press release, she had given over a video, I would assume, or something, for the news agencies. Somebody contacted me on Instagram or something, saying, “Your video’s all over the news.” And I was like… And I already knew, mind you, the lawyer did call a month ago to give me a heads up that they’re moving forward with the thing. So I had it in my mind that something was going to happen soon, and at least… Or whatever. I don’t know if I necessarily knew that my video would be shown, but then I look and it was, it was exciting to see things to come to fruition. It’s a bittersweet… It honestly never should have happened, obviously. This never, ever, I would never wish this upon my worst enemy. But I feel like, thank God that she had found me. The agents… Most of the articles and the news called me a bystander with cell phone video, right. So I don’t know if that’s necessarily the lawyer’s fault. She said she called me an angel or something. I think they just put that into their own words. In my mind, I felt like it was a little belittling to claim that it was a cell phone video because it’s like, oh, cell phone videos, somebody just… We were discussing this, Daniel and I, I don’t know why they wouldn’t have… If it was just a common citizen or just somebody walking down the street, they would have never been able to record that the way that Daniel and I have the ability to get into these scenes or these incidents. To be perfectly honest, I just don’t think that anybody could have done what we did, just to be a common bystander. And I just feel when I was, no, no, no, no, no, it was on my camera, we were there very specifically because they were there, and that they do what they did. And then all these news, they never identify deputies, they never name them. And for whatever it’s worth, it’s like–in any incident that you ever see, you never see… Only recently, Vanessa Brian was able to release five deputy names in her lawsuit, but that seemed like a struggle for her. And to be able to have that ability… And she’s known the names. We were told by the lawyer, well, they gave us these pictures of the deputies, we were given a list of the deputy names, but they didn’t connect any names to any faces. So they just did the minimal amount of turnover for them. So I was like, that’s Kano, that’s [inaudible name]. There’s only two deputies it came down to, which is the first two that actually pulled him over, Walker and Groves, that I’m not sure which one is which, because we weren’t familiar with those deputies. Taya Graham: Have you contacted any of these organizations for credit? And why do you think they don’t want to acknowledge your work? Tom Zebra: The story is… This information is finally available. It’s years and years later. These things have been ongoing, finally the story is coming out, and they’re not going to even say the names of the deputies. So the people involved are still on the street for us to record doing this every night, but they’re not even… The story should be related to the people involved. If it was me or Laura committing the crime, the story would have our names, and we would be publicly humiliated or shamed for our actions. It’s not enough to just mention the sheriff department that has 10,000 deputies. The six guys involved need to be named, because that would hopefully discourage them from continuing to do this night after night after night. But the mainstream media is still not going to publish their names. It’s up to us to publish their names. And we don’t have the audience to get that information out there. So what happens is we end up facing retaliation on the street for trying to expose them. Mainstream media protects the police and the police protects the mainstream media. And yeah, that’s what I think. Taya Graham: But Laura is not alone in her battle against mainstream media. In fact, another popular cop watcher found himself on the wrong end of corporate journalism when he had to take down a video because a local television station claimed that they owned the copyright to dashcam footage. That’s right, this footage you see here was claimed by a local television station who filed a copyright strike against this popular channel run by Dale Lackluster. The strike was perplexing, given that the video in question was created with taxpayer dollars by supposedly public servants. The video was obtained by Lackluster through a public records request. And for more on what happened, I’m joined by Dale Lackluster himself. Dale, thank you so much for joining me. Dale Lackluster: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So, first, just give us a sense of why you started this channel. What prompted you to decide to hold police accountable? Dale Lackluster: Well, for a number of years, I was watching a lot of the First Amendment auditing community. And I have a background in public service. I was a combat medic for the infantry, and after that I became a dual function firefighter-paramedic for Los Angeles City Fire Department. So I had a lot of experience working with the LAPD. And I was kind of aligned with them. I guess most people would commonly refer to that as a bootlicker. And so, for a long time, I was of that mindset. And then I got just kind of interested in these various experiences I was seeing in the First Amendment auditing community. And for a number of years I was paying attention to it and getting more and more sucked into it. And one day I had my own experience. And I had actually called the cops to help my neighbor, as he had told a bunch of our friends in a friend group that he was going to commit suicide. And so that interaction went real negative, for me. And luckily I wasn’t arrested or anything, but it just showed me, you see it happen on the screen so much, but when it finally happens to you is the moment that you realize this can happen to anybody. No matter who you are, what your background is, how much time of your… How many years of your life you’ve devoted to public service, they can still just as easily turn on you. So I figured I had to do something. Taya Graham: So what did the police do to you that changed your mind? Dale Lackluster: Well, basically, I was recording from my front doorstep. And I had one foot in my home and one foot out. And I’d been recording them for about a half an hour, because I was very worried about my neighbor. He was actually a good friend of mine, I’d helped him get a job. And so… It was about 30 minutes that I was standing out there recording them. And they finally geared up, and they had their vests, helmets, riot shields, and all that, and they were going to kick the door in. And it was at that moment where one of the officers turned to me and he said, “Go inside.” And I said, no, I’m over a hundred feet away, the houses were at an angle, so I couldn’t even see the front door. And he’s telling me, “You’re going to get arrested if you don’t go inside.” And so I immediately saw that as a violation of my civil rights, my right to record, not to mention I was on my own personal property. So I mean, that was it, it was real simple. Luckily I wasn’t arrested, I wasn’t summoned. A supervisor was called to the scene. There was an internal investigation. They never said what happened to the guy, or anything. But that little tiny experience for me was enough to say, you know, go do something. Taya Graham: What have you learned about policing through your investigations? Dale Lackluster: I guess quite a bit. The channel started off with me actually actively looking for things to report on. And then it slowly turned into something where I’m getting between 50 and 100 emails a day from people who are saying, “This happened to me. Can you check it out?” “Will this fit on your channel?” And realistically, I could probably put up a dozen videos a day, if I had the time to do that. And it takes me six to eight hours per video that I put out to research and produce and edit and publish. I think what that’s taught me is how big of a problem it is. And that’s just me. I know that for a YouTube channel I have a decent amount of subscribers, but the United States doesn’t know about me. Like one tenth of a percent of the population has heard about me. And I’ve got that many people looking to share their experience with me and trying to get it out to the public. And most of them are egregious violations. And a lot of them are cover-ups or have some sort of sense of cover-ups. And not only that, most of the time the experiences or the interactions and encounters are things that we see over and over and over again. Like, the departments aren’t learning, the cops aren’t learning, and they just keep happening and growing. And maybe that’s just a result of my space as a creator in this field, but to me it looks like it’s an ever-expanding and growing problem. Taya Graham: So do you think the auditing community gets the respect it deserves? Do you think people take it seriously? Dale Lackluster: That’s a really good question. I think it gets the respect that it deserves from the people who know they need it. It’s one of those divisive communities; you’re either all in or you’re all against. And I guess there’s even some division within the community with the way people audit. I hear a lot of people make the argument that the cool, calm demeanor is the right way to go–you catch more flies with honey type of thing. And then you have some of the really volatile auditors that start off with vulgarities immediately. And even in that sense, my view on that is I think that law enforcement needs to be exposed to both. They’re going to scenes where people aren’t going to be sugar and honey or milk and honey, and they need to know how to approach those scenes appropriately. So if it’s always clean and sterile, they’re never going to know how to act appropriately on those calls. So I personally see a benefit from both styles of auditing. But as far as just in general, no, I think the back the blue crowd hates the auditing community, and the auditors love it. Taya Graham: Now, you had a mainstream media outlet exercise a copyright strike against you for posting dashcam footage. Can you talk about what happened? Dale Lackluster: Yeah. I don’t know fully what happened as far as why the copyright strike happened. All of the footage that I used in the video was public domain. It was from the Arkansas State Police. I attempted a FOIA request. They denied me, because I’m not an Arkansas resident. I reached out to my viewers. My viewers responded. And one of them actually obtained the bodycam, or the dashcam footage, for me, sent it to me. And I consulted with my lawyers, made sure that’s all legal, and yes, we got the green light. And so once I got that dashcam footage, I made that video. It went crazy viral. And they had made a story about it, too, because it happened in their little local jurisdiction for their local news channel. And I called the news desk and said, Hey, you guys just copyright striked my channel and took down my video, but it’s public domain and that video was actually featured on The Young Turks, DL Hughley re-posted it, and a bunch of other people. But for some reason, the news channel either thought it was theirs or they had a computer system that just automatically identifies videos that could be theirs and just strikes it automatically without any human review, or they did it maliciously to try to stop my video from getting so many views so that their video could get more views. I don’t know, but I’ve consulted with counsel and we are taking it to court. Taya Graham: So just understand, how can body or dashcam footage, which is created basically by public tax dollars, belong to anyone? How is that not public property? Dale Lackluster: It is public property, there’s no doubt about that, it’s never owned by anyone. So either they have a guy in their copyright room that doesn’t understand Section 207 of the Copyright Act and what public domain is, or they did it maliciously, or it was just really an accident. But either way, the video is back up, the strike’s been taken down. Taya Graham: Can you talk about a video that is of particular importance to you? A video that you feel encapsulates what you do. Dale Lackluster: I guess there’s quite a few. I very rarely have a video that gets some sort of . And it’s something that I get a lot of complaints about, actually, on my channels, that they never see the resolutions from these interactions. And that’s because, simply, litigation takes years. Eric Brandt took seven years to litigate one of his cases. And internal affairs and all that stuff take so much time. And settlements sometimes get slapped with gag orders. So my personal favorite ones are… I guess I don’t have a specific one. But there have been quite a few within the past five or six months where we have an immediate reaction from the local police department, where they either shut down their Facebook page, they terminate the officer, some type of suspension. We’ve had a couple that have resulted in settlements within just a couple months after the incident, so those ones would be my favorite, I guess. Taya Graham: Now, I just want to toss back to Stephen, because I know he’s reached out to the television station in question, and I want to hear if he’s heard back. Stephen, thanks for joining me again, and tell me, what have you heard from the station about their copyright strike? Stephen Janis: Well, I sent them an email with a very specific question: How did you claim a copyright on publicly created documents, information, et cetera? And I have yet to hear back, but I’m going to keep pressing them, because I think this is a fundamental question, and is very important to the auditing community and people like us, who are independent, nonprofit-funded journalism. They’re going to answer the question. They haven’t answered yet, but they will. Taya Graham: Now, I know that the battle between the cop watching community and the mainstream media can seem like inside baseball, I’m even aware of the fact that the plight of a cop watcher with a YouTube channel can seem like a diversion from the true focus of the show, which is watching cops and holding them accountable. But please allow me to push back on that idea a little bit, not just to be ornery, but to make a case for what the alternative media really represents and why it is critical to the health of our fledgling democracy. To do so, I’m going to reference a book called Seeing. It’s a fictional novel by an esteemed Spanish writer, José Saramago. And the book tells the tale of a city where very odd and inexplicable thing happens. During an election, most of the residents of the capital city go to the polls, and almost all of them cast blank votes. This is despite actually dropping a ballot in the ballot box. Most of them did not check off a specific candidate. The appearance of the so-called blankers creates confrontation, confusion, and even threats of violence from the political elites. In fact, the ruling class is so confused the entire government abandons the city completely, expecting the community to erupt into chaos. But instead, the opposite occurs, promoting the country’s leadership to resort to even more extreme measures. Now, I don’t want to give away the whole story, but the reason why I bring up this book is because I think it makes a point about what the mainstream media ignores, or, in some cases, even tries to thwart, with cop watchers. Because I think the people who seek alternative media sources like Laura Shark and Lackluster are the contemporary equivalent to blankers: people who refuse to buy into the status quo and seek truth where it can exist without fear or favor. And that’s also why mainstream media hits back: because of fear. Fear that people who choose to assemble and obtain knowledge outside of the purview of the status quo represent a threat to it. That those who don’t turn to the greed infused media for the truth are skeptical of the irrational narratives it espouses. As we discussed last week, the nation’s war on drugs was an utter disaster that did nothing–and I mean nothing–to reduce addiction or the suffering associated with drug use. Just consider the fact that this year the DEA, our huge drug enforcement administration, is spending billions and making thousands of drug possession arrests, but overdose deaths rose to their highest level ever: 90,000 people dead. Now, compare that to the breathless coverage from the mainstream media about the heroic efforts of drug warriors, about the scourge of drug dealing in our dangerous cities, about all the wonderful successes that have led to the largest experiment in mass incarceration in the history of human civilization. And so, like the people in the book Seeing, if we collectively decide that this narrative is simply not worth paying attention to, the corporate media fights back with their rational acts, like using a video without attribution, or copyright striking body camera footage. This is how they fight back when we ignore their offerings and do our own reporting or watch auditors like Laura Shark or Tom Zebra and Lackluster, and this is what happens when we choose to ignore their irrational narratives, seeking to justify that the possession of mind-altering substances should lead to arrest, loss of freedom, and even sometimes loss of our lives. We simply become blankers, and they just can’t stand it, so they try to stop it. Maybe, just maybe, the people we spoke to today are a threat to the insanity that our corporate media counterparts have embraced for years. Maybe journalism for and by the people is the only thing that will save us from the idea that it’s okay for people to get sick and go bankrupt, or for cops to take property without charging people, or making an arrest. Maybe that’s why large corporations either appropriate or block the work of these auditors. But that’s also why we will keep reporting on what they do, and holding the people that want to stop them accountable. I want to thank Laura Shark, Tom Zebra, and Dale Lackluster for their important work and for taking the time to sit down with us and discuss it. Thank you all so much. And, of course, I have to thank intrepid journalist Stephen Janis for his writing, research, and editing on this piece. And, of course, I would be remiss if I did not thank friend of the show Noli Dee for her support. Thanks, Noli Dee. And I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please share it with us, and we might be able to investigate. Please reach out to us. You can email us tips privately at PAR@therealnews.com and share your evidence of police misconduct. You can also message us at Police Accountability Report on Facebook or Instagram, or @eyesonpolice on Twitter. Of course, you can always message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter or Facebook, and please like and comment. I do read your comments and appreciate them, and I try to answer your questions whenever I can. And if you want to help us continue, please consider donating to our Patreon, Police Accountability Reports. My name is Taya Graham, and I’m your host to the Police Accountability Report. Please be safe out there. Citizen journalists continue to play a critical role in holding police accountable, which is why they face increasing pushback from the underlying system that bolsters bad cops. PAR speaks to cop watchers Laura Shark and Lackluster about the challenges they face when reporting on police, and how auditing law enforcement has become an increasingly dicey occupation. \n",

      " Content: Hundreds of workers at the Frito-Lay manufacturing and distribution plant in Topeka, Kansas, have been on strike since July 5. Workers at Frito-Lay have endured years of disrespect, and many at the plant have seen their wages stagnate and fall behind other employers in the area. On top of that, workers have been caught in a horrible cycle that was greatly exacerbated by COVID 19: While more people stayed home during the pandemic and ate a lot more chips, the incredibly high turnover at Frito-Lay means that folks who stayed on have been forced to work longer hours, with some pulling 12-hour shifts seven days a week for weeks on end. In this urgent episode, we talk with Cheri Renfro, who has worked at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka for 9 years and is currently on strike.

Send us a voice message, and we might play your message on the show. Let’s see if we have any messages. Voicemail:         You have one new message. Mark:             Hello. My name’s Mark. I’m from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I use he/him pronouns, and right now I work a couple of different part-time jobs saving up money for grad school. I want to talk about just a fun little piece of joy I had in my life the other week. I was out with some friends at a bar, and we were thinking about what we were going to do for my birthday which was coming up, and we wanted to go out to drink. And we didn’t know, could we do a theme or some sort of, make it a theme night. And there was a bunch of people at the bar who were all wearing shirts from the boilermakers union. They worked at the shipyard that was about an hour away from us. They were being real rowdy and having a real good time, and it struck me. I was like, oh, that’s it. That’s the energy I want for my birthday. So, me and my twin sister went out to drinks with a couple of our friends, and the theme was union strong, and it was really nice. I shared all of my union pins, and a bunch of people had union shirts on, and we had a real good time. We sang Solidarity Forever while we were walking between bars, and I just wanted to let all the union folks out there know that there’s a young generation out here who are really primed to get really invested in labor politics, and we’re coming up, and we’re ready to fight with you. I’m not in a union yet, but I’m going to teacher education starting in August, and I can’t wait to sign that union card. So, anyway, solidarity with everyone. Hope you have joy in this next week. Announcer:         Thanks for your message, Mark. Solidarity to you and your comrades, and happy birthday. We can’t wait for you to sign that union card, too.

We love hearing from you guys. All right. Well, as we posted on Twitter earlier this week, our episode this week was a little delayed because we needed a little extra time for it to come together, but believe me when I say that it’s well worth the wait. As you all may have heard by now, hundreds of workers at the Frito-Lay manufacturing and distribution plant in Topeka, Kansas, have been on strike since July 5. Workers at Frito-Lay have endured years of disrespect, and most classifications of workers at the plant have seen their wages stagnate and fall behind other employers in the area. On top of that, workers have been caught in this horrible cycle that was greatly exacerbated by COVID-19. While more people were staying home during the pandemic, and apparently eating a shit ton of chips, the incredibly high turnover at Frito-Lay has meant that the folks who have stayed on have been forced to work longer hours to cover the difference, with some pulling 12-hour shifts seven days a week for weeks on end. As Dan DiMaggio writes in a really great article for Labor Notes, quote, “One of the most hated forms of forced overtime at the plant is being forced to work, quote, ‘suicide.’ That’s when the company makes a worker stay four hours on top of their eight-hour shift, and then forces them in four hours early before their next shift, leaving them only eight hours off,” end quote. I mean, if that doesn’t sound horrible enough, then, I don’t know, check your pulse, because that sounds awful. \n",

      " Content: Local television news crews descended on West Baltimore’s historic Black Poppleton neighborhood on the afternoon of July 12, after bulldozers knocked down several vacants whose construction dates back to the 1840s. After the cameras were gone, Parcha McFadden embraced her 8-year-old daughter on the steps of her home where she has lived for the past four decades. She fears her home could be the next to go. The McFaddens are among the last longtime residents the city wants to clear out to make way for luxury developments, but the community is fighting to preserve their home.  Residents and organizers of Organize Poppleton who gathered to speak to the local media said the demolition was retaliation for their organizing efforts, which have aimed to pressure the city to allow them to stay in their homes. They noted that it took place just hours before the community was set to argue that those very buildings must be preserved. Less than two days earlier, 100 people had rallied at the adjacent Sarah Ann Park to listen to live music and to learn about the fight against the two-decade-old deal the city made with La Cité Development, a well-connected New York developer that was supposed to revitalize the economically depressed area that’s close to downtown amenities.  “It seems like it’s not fair for the homeowners who have invested so much, whose homes have so much history and meaning for their families,” Mcfadden said.  A Change.org petition supporting Poppleton residents’ efforts to stay in their homes had just 619 signatures on July 9th but had surpassed 2,200 four days later. \n",

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello, my name is Taya Graham, and welcome to The Police Accountability Report. As I always try to make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we question the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, it’s that same system that we will be holding accountable because we will be retelling the tragic story of this woman, who is breaking her silence after 46 years about how the flawed war on drugs ruined her life and her family. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And of course, you can always message me directly at Taya’s Baltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and we now have a Patreon account called Accountability Reports, so if you have a few dollars to spare, it would really help us keep doing these investigations for you. Okay, now we’ve got all of that out of the way. Now as anyone who watches this show already knows, Stephen and I spent the last five years documenting the firing of the first black police chief of a small town called Pocomoke. This community on Maryland’s lower eastern shore had caught our attention because the chief, a former Baltimore homicide detective, Kelvin Sewell, had implemented a form of community policing that was both popular and successful. Sewell had implemented an idea that was both radical, and when you think about it, fairly simple. He ordered his officers to get out of their cars and walk and talk to people, a move that made residents feel like police were there to serve them, not the other way around. But unfortunately, Sewell’s strategy was also at odds with the drug war, putting him in the cross hairs of a nearby countywide drug unit. That conflict got Sewell into trouble, and you can watch the story for free by clicking on a link that we’ll have pinned in the comment section. But the reason I’m bringing up the documentary is because it played a role in the story we’re telling today. That’s because shortly after we released the film, we received a call from a woman who was distraught. In fact, her message to us was so emotional, at first we thought she was angry about the work that we do. But it turned out that was not the case. In fact, Sewell’s story had elicited her emotions because I unearthed memories of her own painful encounter with the corrupt power of politicized policing. It is a story so heart wrenching, we felt compelled to share it with you. First, let me set the scene a bit. The woman who called us is named Catherine Freeman. She lives in a small town on Maryland’s lower eastern shore called Snow Hill. That’s where we traveled to speak to her in a local library, and that’s where she shared her pain. The story starts in the early 1970s. Catherine was a young mother and deeply in love with her husband, Patrick Carey. The couple had settled in a farmhouse in Worcester County, where they welcomed the birth of their first daughter. As she recalls, her husband had just returned from serving in the Vietnam War as a medic. He’d also just finished training at Johns Hopkins University to become a full-time EMT. But the idyllic life that the pair had fashioned would soon be destroyed. That’s because her husband also happened to be the son of the local sheriff, which is an important detail in this story, but that was the last thing on her mind when a stranger paid her family a visit. I’ll let her tell the story. Catherine Freeman: I was 19, and I married Pat Carey, who was the son of Eugene Carey, who was the sheriff of Wicomico County. We lived on a farmhouse in Stockton, Maryland, back in the middle of nowhere, where we weren’t bothering a soul. It was just the three of us. Eugene Carey was appointed sheriff of Wicomico County after the sheriff there was killed, and he had been the sheriff of Wicomico County, and then the election came up for the next election, which he ran for. It was election time. A man in Snow Hill, I don’t know if you want me to say names, but you know who he was. Anyhow, he befriended Pat, who if you knew Pat, that’s how he was. He loved everybody. So this man came over to our house a couple times for beers, and we smoked weed. Maybe two or three weeks after he comes into our life, and I have a baby, so a newborn basically, he comes one night, Saturday night, and says … He’d already left some of his belongings there, so I think that’s how the sheriff’s department got into our house because he had some of his belongings there. And he said, “Listen, I’ve got this weed, and hold onto it for me,” which I didn’t even know it was in the house. We had personal weed to smoke, but this was a pound. And in 1974, a pound is a lot of weed. Taya Graham: Two hours after the mysterious man left, she was awakened in the middle of the night. And I’ll let her explain what happened next. Catherine Freeman: So I’m in bed asleep. This man leaves the house. Two hours after he left the house, they show up, guns blazing. We were held at gunpoint. I was in bed asleep. It woke me up. I looked out the window and I get a spotlight in my face, that says, “There’s people upstairs,” and then I hear all this yelling. The nursery was right next to my room. I run in to Katie because I don’t know what’s going on. Pat runs into the room and says, “Cathy, the cops are here.” And I’m going like, “What do you mean the cops are here?” And the attic door was in the baby’s room. It was an old farmhouse. And I didn’t realize at the time what he was doing, but he went up in the attic real quick and ran back down. And of course by that time, the police were at us, in the house, gun point, all that. As soon as they found the pound of marijuana, they quit looking. They didn’t look for nothing else. They found it up in the attic because that’s where Pat had taken it because there was other weed in the house they didn’t find because they quit looking. And of course, we were arrested. That was with a pound of marijuana in 1974 by the Worcester County sheriff’s department that did not belong to us. We never heard from the informant again. He never called the next day to say, “I’m coming to get the pound of marijuana.” He never called the day after to say, “Are you okay? What happened? Where’s my weed?” We never heard from the man again. Taya Graham: So her husband, a veteran who served his country, and an EMT who dedicated his life to saving others, was accused of being a drug dealer and was facing a lengthy prison sentence, as you can see in this newspaper clip here. The mainstream media embraced this narrative. It was a debilitating turn of events for the whole family. But for Freeman, there was also the coincidence of the man who showed up their house, left his belongings, and then never returned. Could it be that the strange sequence of events was simply happenstance? Was it simply a string of bad luck that brought those two events together? Let’s listen to Catherine explain why she believes there was more to the story. Catherine Freeman: Of course, they charge him with distribution, the whole nine yards. He could’ve gone to jail for a long, long time. Speaker: So they charged him like he was a drug dealer. Catherine Freeman: Yes, right. Speaker: How did this affect him? Catherine Freeman: Well, he’d already had issues from the Vietnam War. I was only 19 and Pat was 28. I’m from Snow Hill. He’d been around the world several times. He was a man of the world to me. So of course, he calls his dad right away and tells him. And then the next thing we know, they want to make a deal. This is what we want you to do. If you want to get out of this, this is what you’ll do. Speaker: What was the deal? Catherine Freeman: Plead guilty to possession, probation, and that Eugene back off of running for sheriff of Wicomico County. And he did not win, and that was the end of his career. And he was a veteran too, a military veteran. And it was awful what they did to him. They were both honest men, Pat and his father, Eugene Carey. And they did not deserve what happened. And that was one of the reasons why I feel I have to say something. It’s not about me, it’s about them. But because he married and he was in Worcester County, that’s what happened to him. Taya Graham: So the message was clear according to Catherine. A drug informant who appeared to be working with the police had entered their lives at a time when her father in law was mounting a campaign for sheriff. The arrest had turned her loving husband into a drug dealer, and mainstream media picked up and ran with that narrative. But that’s now where this story ends. And before I let Catherine tell us what happened next, I’m joined by reporting Partner, Stephen Janis, who has been investigating to give us background. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: First, you researched the arrest of Catherine’s husband. What did you find out? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s really interesting because none of the records are of course available online. You have to go back 50 years. Catherine shared a newspaper article, which I was able to find on a newspaper site. And what’s really interesting about it is that the article itself doesn’t really recount much of what the crime actually was, but it does in the headline emphasize that he is the son of a candidate, and that’s all the article really tells you. And the headline is kind of blaring, and so it gives you the impression that this was possibly a setup because if you look at it, it’s pretty clear that what they wanted to emphasize was not the crime, or the effect, or the impact of the crime, or the severity of the crime, but rather the political affiliation of the person who they were charging. Taya Graham: Now the war on drugs has been a mass casualty event for most of our country. How bad has it been and what do the numbers tell us? Stephen Janis: Well, let’s think about this statistic. According to the American Progress, there is one arrest for a drug possession every 26 seconds in this country. Since the 1970s, the US has spent over $1 trillion on the war on drugs. And the US government, the federal government, spends $3.3 billion a year incarcerating people just for possession. So really, it’s hard not to look at those numbers and say, “This is devastating.” Taya Graham: Now finally, this story reminds me of a concept that you have talked about before, the powerful and destructive legal invention that you call proximity crimes. Can you explain this concept and how it pertains here? Stephen Janis: Well, so many bad cases in the city always started with a simple phrase from police. I had smelled marijuana. And once they smelled marijuana, they can throw out any sort of civil protections any person has. It’s the pretext for all sorts of dominating power when it comes to policing. The possession or the proximity of drugs in any situation gives police license to take your property, take your freedom, do anything really in that situation, and ascribe all sorts of motivations to you, which may or may not be true. So proximity crimes are probably the laziest form of crime developed by our legal system and has facilitated a horrible and costly war on drugs. Taya Graham: Now as I said before, Catherine’s husband faced serious charges. But behind the scenes, a message was sent that it could all go away. But there was a catch, which I will let Catherine explain. Catherine Freeman: Well, his family kind of despised me after that because they kind of felt like if it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have been here. It cost thousands of dollars, the fine and the attorney. Eugene’s career was done. He didn’t do anything in law enforcement anymore. And Pat, he just tried to make the best of it. Taya Graham: And the pain for her was intense, a story so painful, she explained to us why she waited nearly 50 years to tell it. Catherine Freeman: I mean, we were honest people, and they made us look dishonest. Why after 47 years would I sit here and say we weren’t set up if I’m not telling the truth? I’ve had two men in my life that I felt treated badly, and their life was, their careers were ruined. They were veterans, they are veterans, military veterans. And they were accused of things that weren’t true. They were set up. They did nothing wrong. Taya Graham: So as this story points out, and as we’ve said before, policing is not the product of the desire for public safety as law enforcement and politicians often argue. Our idea of a crime is not the extension of some philosophical sense of justice. And even more important, our sense of right and wrong is not the driving force behind a set of laws that can ruin a man’s life over a pound, just a pound, of a weed that grows naturally and provides medical comfort to millions. The story that Catherine Freeman so bravely shared reveals a less scrutinized by more toxic imperative for the proliferation of cops and prisons across this country. What her story illustrates is the notion that law enforcement is a means to project power. And it’s important to understand the calculus behind that power, and who is wielding if it we are truly going to reform our massive law enforcement industrial complex. So what exactly do I mean? Well, consider this study out of The University of Seattle. It is a detailed examination of the police tactics we have discussed quite often on the show, taking people’s property without charging them with a crime, also known as civil asset forfeiture. It is a strategy used by police to seize the property of purported criminals without due process because as law enforcement reassures us, doing so deprives criminals of the proceeds from illegal acts. So a set of economists set out to see if there is any evidence that this process works. And what they found is not only troubling, but speaks to the sort of perversion of power I think is exemplified in Catherine’s case. For example, they found that asset forfeiture programs in five states not only did not reduce crime, but actually seemed to incentivize bad policing. One of the examples of this idea contained in the report is the case of Detroit resident, Stephanie Wilson. Wilson was picking up her ex husband in January of 2019 from a gas station when police surrounded her car. They confiscated the vehicle and impounded it, though they never arrested her or her ex husband, who was homeless at the time. The car was not returned because she didn’t file the proper paperwork to fight the seizure, which must be completed in less than 20 days. But that isn’t the end of her story. A few months later, Stephanie bought another car with a tax refund. And as hard as it is to believe, the police impounded that car too, again without arresting her for any crime. This time, the police told her she’d have to pay $1800 to regain possession of property she already owned. What drives this kind of insane public policy is simple according to the report. Greed, that’s because Michigan, like many states, allows police to keep all the proceeds from the property they seize. Please let me repeat that. It allows police to keep all the proceeds from the property they seize. In fact, researchers found a troubling correlation between budgetary pressure and increased asset forfeiture, specifically states where unemployment rose, also experienced an increase in property seizures by police. And let’s remember, these are not trifling amounts of money. According to the same study, police departments across the country have raked in $68 billion, billion with a B, since 2000. Put simply, they are using the ambiguity of the law and the general lack of respect for the Bill of Rights to extract wealth from communities that can least afford it. So how does this all relate to the story I just told you? Well, when you think about it, it is clear that strategies like the war on drugs have transformed law enforcement into not just an arbiter of politics, but a mechanism to redistribute wealth through power. It is a terrifying combination where the ability to take our freedom and our assets are fused together into one single sprawling institution that can insulate itself from accountability through the power of the law. This evolution of the law enforcement industrial complex that can both confiscate freedom and property is a fundamental violation of the entire concept that this country was founded on. I mean, think about it, the one thing the drafters of the Constitution feared, it was the consolidation of power into too few hands. It is one of the reasons we have three separate branches of government, all of which are supposed to function as a check and balance on the other, which raises a critical question about policing we must confront. Can we sustain and preserve our freedom when we convey this type of power to self serving institutions like law enforcement? Are we creating a fatal flaw in our democratic form of governance by enabling this type of overreach to continue? I want you to think about something when you answer that question, just a thought to put this in real terms. In this country, someone could drop a small amount of cocaine or pot on your property, call police, and watch while you’re put in handcuffs and your property is confiscated. The law does not require any sort of proof you purchased the drugs, tried to deal them, or that you were otherwise involved in the chain of events that put them there in the first place. It’s kind of a scary thought in light of the story we shared today and all the others we have in the past. Should another human being be granted that type of power? Should any individual be allowed to exercise that sort of discretion to incriminate and violate the rights of any person? Well, I think these are troubling questions that we have to try to answer. And certainly, we intend to not stop asking because that is indeed the point of this, to make sure someone answers them. I want to thank my guest, Miss Freeman, for coming forward and trusting us to share her experience. And of course, I have to thank intrepid reporter, Stephen Janis, for his writing, research, and editing on this piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

As I always try to make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we question the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, it’s that same system that we will be holding accountable because we will be retelling the tragic story of this woman, who is breaking her silence after 46 years about how the flawed war on drugs ruined her life and her family.

Okay, now we’ve got all of that out of the way. Now as anyone who watches this show already knows, Stephen and I spent the last five years documenting the firing of the first black police chief of a small town called Pocomoke. This community on Maryland’s lower eastern shore had caught our attention because the chief, a former Baltimore homicide detective, Kelvin Sewell, had implemented a form of community policing that was both popular and successful. Sewell had implemented an idea that was both radical, and when you think about it, fairly simple. He ordered his officers to get out of their cars and walk and talk to people, a move that made residents feel like police were there to serve them, not the other way around. But unfortunately, Sewell’s strategy was also at odds with the drug war, putting him in the cross hairs of a nearby countywide drug unit. That conflict got Sewell into trouble, and you can watch the story for free by clicking on a link that we’ll have pinned in the comment section. But the reason I’m bringing up the documentary is because it played a role in the story we’re telling today. That’s because shortly after we released the film, we received a call from a woman who was distraught. In fact, her message to us was so emotional, at first we thought she was angry about the work that we do. But it turned out that was not the case. In fact, Sewell’s story had elicited her emotions because I unearthed memories of her own painful encounter with the corrupt power of politicized policing. It is a story so heart wrenching, we felt compelled to share it with you. First, let me set the scene a bit. The woman who called us is named Catherine Freeman. She lives in a small town on Maryland’s lower eastern shore called Snow Hill. That’s where we traveled to speak to her in a local library, and that’s where she shared her pain. The story starts in the early 1970s. Catherine was a young mother and deeply in love with her husband, Patrick Carey. The couple had settled in a farmhouse in Worcester County, where they welcomed the birth of their first daughter. As she recalls, her husband had just returned from serving in the Vietnam War as a medic. He’d also just finished training at Johns Hopkins University to become a full-time EMT. But the idyllic life that the pair had fashioned would soon be destroyed. That’s because her husband also happened to be the son of the local sheriff, which is an important detail in this story, but that was the last thing on her mind when a stranger paid her family a visit. I’ll let her tell the story. Catherine Freeman: I was 19, and I married Pat Carey, who was the son of Eugene Carey, who was the sheriff of Wicomico County. We lived on a farmhouse in Stockton, Maryland, back in the middle of nowhere, where we weren’t bothering a soul. It was just the three of us. Eugene Carey was appointed sheriff of Wicomico County after the sheriff there was killed, and he had been the sheriff of Wicomico County, and then the election came up for the next election, which he ran for. It was election time. A man in Snow Hill, I don’t know if you want me to say names, but you know who he was. Anyhow, he befriended Pat, who if you knew Pat, that’s how he was. He loved everybody. So this man came over to our house a couple times for beers, and we smoked weed. Maybe two or three weeks after he comes into our life, and I have a baby, so a newborn basically, he comes one night, Saturday night, and says … He’d already left some of his belongings there, so I think that’s how the sheriff’s department got into our house because he had some of his belongings there. And he said, “Listen, I’ve got this weed, and hold onto it for me,” which I didn’t even know it was in the house. We had personal weed to smoke, but this was a pound. And in 1974, a pound is a lot of weed. Taya Graham: Two hours after the mysterious man left, she was awakened in the middle of the night. And I’ll let her explain what happened next. Catherine Freeman: So I’m in bed asleep. This man leaves the house. Two hours after he left the house, they show up, guns blazing. We were held at gunpoint. I was in bed asleep. It woke me up. I looked out the window and I get a spotlight in my face, that says, “There’s people upstairs,” and then I hear all this yelling. The nursery was right next to my room. I run in to Katie because I don’t know what’s going on. Pat runs into the room and says, “Cathy, the cops are here.” And I’m going like, “What do you mean the cops are here?” And the attic door was in the baby’s room. It was an old farmhouse. And I didn’t realize at the time what he was doing, but he went up in the attic real quick and ran back down. And of course by that time, the police were at us, in the house, gun point, all that. As soon as they found the pound of marijuana, they quit looking. They didn’t look for nothing else. They found it up in the attic because that’s where Pat had taken it because there was other weed in the house they didn’t find because they quit looking. And of course, we were arrested. That was with a pound of marijuana in 1974 by the Worcester County sheriff’s department that did not belong to us. We never heard from the informant again. He never called the next day to say, “I’m coming to get the pound of marijuana.” He never called the day after to say, “Are you okay? What happened? Where’s my weed?” We never heard from the man again. Taya Graham: So her husband, a veteran who served his country, and an EMT who dedicated his life to saving others, was accused of being a drug dealer and was facing a lengthy prison sentence, as you can see in this newspaper clip here. The mainstream media embraced this narrative. It was a debilitating turn of events for the whole family. But for Freeman, there was also the coincidence of the man who showed up their house, left his belongings, and then never returned. Could it be that the strange sequence of events was simply happenstance? Was it simply a string of bad luck that brought those two events together? Let’s listen to Catherine explain why she believes there was more to the story. Catherine Freeman: Of course, they charge him with distribution, the whole nine yards. He could’ve gone to jail for a long, long time. Speaker: So they charged him like he was a drug dealer. Catherine Freeman: Yes, right. Speaker: How did this affect him? Catherine Freeman: Well, he’d already had issues from the Vietnam War. I was only 19 and Pat was 28. I’m from Snow Hill. He’d been around the world several times. He was a man of the world to me. So of course, he calls his dad right away and tells him. And then the next thing we know, they want to make a deal. This is what we want you to do. If you want to get out of this, this is what you’ll do. Speaker: What was the deal? Catherine Freeman: Plead guilty to possession, probation, and that Eugene back off of running for sheriff of Wicomico County. And he did not win, and that was the end of his career. And he was a veteran too, a military veteran. And it was awful what they did to him. They were both honest men, Pat and his father, Eugene Carey. And they did not deserve what happened. And that was one of the reasons why I feel I have to say something. It’s not about me, it’s about them. But because he married and he was in Worcester County, that’s what happened to him. Taya Graham: So the message was clear according to Catherine. A drug informant who appeared to be working with the police had entered their lives at a time when her father in law was mounting a campaign for sheriff. The arrest had turned her loving husband into a drug dealer, and mainstream media picked up and ran with that narrative. But that’s now where this story ends. And before I let Catherine tell us what happened next, I’m joined by reporting Partner, Stephen Janis, who has been investigating to give us background. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: First, you researched the arrest of Catherine’s husband. What did you find out? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s really interesting because none of the records are of course available online. You have to go back 50 years. Catherine shared a newspaper article, which I was able to find on a newspaper site. And what’s really interesting about it is that the article itself doesn’t really recount much of what the crime actually was, but it does in the headline emphasize that he is the son of a candidate, and that’s all the article really tells you. And the headline is kind of blaring, and so it gives you the impression that this was possibly a setup because if you look at it, it’s pretty clear that what they wanted to emphasize was not the crime, or the effect, or the impact of the crime, or the severity of the crime, but rather the political affiliation of the person who they were charging. Taya Graham: Now the war on drugs has been a mass casualty event for most of our country. How bad has it been and what do the numbers tell us? Stephen Janis: Well, let’s think about this statistic. According to the American Progress, there is one arrest for a drug possession every 26 seconds in this country. Since the 1970s, the US has spent over $1 trillion on the war on drugs. And the US government, the federal government, spends $3.3 billion a year incarcerating people just for possession. So really, it’s hard not to look at those numbers and say, “This is devastating.” Taya Graham: Now finally, this story reminds me of a concept that you have talked about before, the powerful and destructive legal invention that you call proximity crimes. Can you explain this concept and how it pertains here? Stephen Janis: Well, so many bad cases in the city always started with a simple phrase from police. I had smelled marijuana. And once they smelled marijuana, they can throw out any sort of civil protections any person has. It’s the pretext for all sorts of dominating power when it comes to policing. The possession or the proximity of drugs in any situation gives police license to take your property, take your freedom, do anything really in that situation, and ascribe all sorts of motivations to you, which may or may not be true. So proximity crimes are probably the laziest form of crime developed by our legal system and has facilitated a horrible and costly war on drugs. Taya Graham: Now as I said before, Catherine’s husband faced serious charges. But behind the scenes, a message was sent that it could all go away. But there was a catch, which I will let Catherine explain. Catherine Freeman: Well, his family kind of despised me after that because they kind of felt like if it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have been here. It cost thousands of dollars, the fine and the attorney. Eugene’s career was done. He didn’t do anything in law enforcement anymore. And Pat, he just tried to make the best of it. Taya Graham: And the pain for her was intense, a story so painful, she explained to us why she waited nearly 50 years to tell it. Catherine Freeman: I mean, we were honest people, and they made us look dishonest. Why after 47 years would I sit here and say we weren’t set up if I’m not telling the truth? I’ve had two men in my life that I felt treated badly, and their life was, their careers were ruined. They were veterans, they are veterans, military veterans. And they were accused of things that weren’t true. They were set up. They did nothing wrong. Taya Graham: So as this story points out, and as we’ve said before, policing is not the product of the desire for public safety as law enforcement and politicians often argue. Our idea of a crime is not the extension of some philosophical sense of justice. And even more important, our sense of right and wrong is not the driving force behind a set of laws that can ruin a man’s life over a pound, just a pound, of a weed that grows naturally and provides medical comfort to millions. The story that Catherine Freeman so bravely shared reveals a less scrutinized by more toxic imperative for the proliferation of cops and prisons across this country. What her story illustrates is the notion that law enforcement is a means to project power. And it’s important to understand the calculus behind that power, and who is wielding if it we are truly going to reform our massive law enforcement industrial complex. So what exactly do I mean? Well, consider this study out of The University of Seattle. It is a detailed examination of the police tactics we have discussed quite often on the show, taking people’s property without charging them with a crime, also known as civil asset forfeiture. It is a strategy used by police to seize the property of purported criminals without due process because as law enforcement reassures us, doing so deprives criminals of the proceeds from illegal acts. So a set of economists set out to see if there is any evidence that this process works. And what they found is not only troubling, but speaks to the sort of perversion of power I think is exemplified in Catherine’s case. For example, they found that asset forfeiture programs in five states not only did not reduce crime, but actually seemed to incentivize bad policing. One of the examples of this idea contained in the report is the case of Detroit resident, Stephanie Wilson. Wilson was picking up her ex husband in January of 2019 from a gas station when police surrounded her car. They confiscated the vehicle and impounded it, though they never arrested her or her ex husband, who was homeless at the time. The car was not returned because she didn’t file the proper paperwork to fight the seizure, which must be completed in less than 20 days. But that isn’t the end of her story. A few months later, Stephanie bought another car with a tax refund. And as hard as it is to believe, the police impounded that car too, again without arresting her for any crime. This time, the police told her she’d have to pay $1800 to regain possession of property she already owned. What drives this kind of insane public policy is simple according to the report. Greed, that’s because Michigan, like many states, allows police to keep all the proceeds from the property they seize. Please let me repeat that. It allows police to keep all the proceeds from the property they seize. In fact, researchers found a troubling correlation between budgetary pressure and increased asset forfeiture, specifically states where unemployment rose, also experienced an increase in property seizures by police. And let’s remember, these are not trifling amounts of money. According to the same study, police departments across the country have raked in $68 billion, billion with a B, since 2000. Put simply, they are using the ambiguity of the law and the general lack of respect for the Bill of Rights to extract wealth from communities that can least afford it. So how does this all relate to the story I just told you? Well, when you think about it, it is clear that strategies like the war on drugs have transformed law enforcement into not just an arbiter of politics, but a mechanism to redistribute wealth through power. It is a terrifying combination where the ability to take our freedom and our assets are fused together into one single sprawling institution that can insulate itself from accountability through the power of the law. This evolution of the law enforcement industrial complex that can both confiscate freedom and property is a fundamental violation of the entire concept that this country was founded on. I mean, think about it, the one thing the drafters of the Constitution feared, it was the consolidation of power into too few hands. It is one of the reasons we have three separate branches of government, all of which are supposed to function as a check and balance on the other, which raises a critical question about policing we must confront. Can we sustain and preserve our freedom when we convey this type of power to self serving institutions like law enforcement? Are we creating a fatal flaw in our democratic form of governance by enabling this type of overreach to continue? I want you to think about something when you answer that question, just a thought to put this in real terms. In this country, someone could drop a small amount of cocaine or pot on your property, call police, and watch while you’re put in handcuffs and your property is confiscated. The law does not require any sort of proof you purchased the drugs, tried to deal them, or that you were otherwise involved in the chain of events that put them there in the first place. It’s kind of a scary thought in light of the story we shared today and all the others we have in the past. Should another human being be granted that type of power? Should any individual be allowed to exercise that sort of discretion to incriminate and violate the rights of any person? Well, I think these are troubling questions that we have to try to answer. And certainly, we intend to not stop asking because that is indeed the point of this, to make sure someone answers them. I want to thank my guest, Miss Freeman, for coming forward and trusting us to share her experience.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello, my name is Taya Graham, and welcome to The Police Accountability Report. As I always try to make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we question the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, it’s that same system that we will be holding accountable because we will be retelling the tragic story of this woman, who is breaking her silence after 46 years about how the flawed war on drugs ruined her life and her family. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And of course, you can always message me directly at Taya’s Baltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and we now have a Patreon account called Accountability Reports, so if you have a few dollars to spare, it would really help us keep doing these investigations for you. Okay, now we’ve got all of that out of the way. Now as anyone who watches this show already knows, Stephen and I spent the last five years documenting the firing of the first black police chief of a small town called Pocomoke. This community on Maryland’s lower eastern shore had caught our attention because the chief, a former Baltimore homicide detective, Kelvin Sewell, had implemented a form of community policing that was both popular and successful. Sewell had implemented an idea that was both radical, and when you think about it, fairly simple. He ordered his officers to get out of their cars and walk and talk to people, a move that made residents feel like police were there to serve them, not the other way around. But unfortunately, Sewell’s strategy was also at odds with the drug war, putting him in the cross hairs of a nearby countywide drug unit. That conflict got Sewell into trouble, and you can watch the story for free by clicking on a link that we’ll have pinned in the comment section. But the reason I’m bringing up the documentary is because it played a role in the story we’re telling today. That’s because shortly after we released the film, we received a call from a woman who was distraught. In fact, her message to us was so emotional, at first we thought she was angry about the work that we do. But it turned out that was not the case. In fact, Sewell’s story had elicited her emotions because I unearthed memories of her own painful encounter with the corrupt power of politicized policing. It is a story so heart wrenching, we felt compelled to share it with you. First, let me set the scene a bit. The woman who called us is named Catherine Freeman. She lives in a small town on Maryland’s lower eastern shore called Snow Hill. That’s where we traveled to speak to her in a local library, and that’s where she shared her pain. The story starts in the early 1970s. Catherine was a young mother and deeply in love with her husband, Patrick Carey. The couple had settled in a farmhouse in Worcester County, where they welcomed the birth of their first daughter. As she recalls, her husband had just returned from serving in the Vietnam War as a medic. He’d also just finished training at Johns Hopkins University to become a full-time EMT. But the idyllic life that the pair had fashioned would soon be destroyed. That’s because her husband also happened to be the son of the local sheriff, which is an important detail in this story, but that was the last thing on her mind when a stranger paid her family a visit. I’ll let her tell the story. Catherine Freeman: I was 19, and I married Pat Carey, who was the son of Eugene Carey, who was the sheriff of Wicomico County. We lived on a farmhouse in Stockton, Maryland, back in the middle of nowhere, where we weren’t bothering a soul. It was just the three of us. Eugene Carey was appointed sheriff of Wicomico County after the sheriff there was killed, and he had been the sheriff of Wicomico County, and then the election came up for the next election, which he ran for. It was election time. A man in Snow Hill, I don’t know if you want me to say names, but you know who he was. Anyhow, he befriended Pat, who if you knew Pat, that’s how he was. He loved everybody. So this man came over to our house a couple times for beers, and we smoked weed. Maybe two or three weeks after he comes into our life, and I have a baby, so a newborn basically, he comes one night, Saturday night, and says … He’d already left some of his belongings there, so I think that’s how the sheriff’s department got into our house because he had some of his belongings there. And he said, “Listen, I’ve got this weed, and hold onto it for me,” which I didn’t even know it was in the house. We had personal weed to smoke, but this was a pound. And in 1974, a pound is a lot of weed. Taya Graham: Two hours after the mysterious man left, she was awakened in the middle of the night. And I’ll let her explain what happened next. Catherine Freeman: So I’m in bed asleep. This man leaves the house. Two hours after he left the house, they show up, guns blazing. We were held at gunpoint. I was in bed asleep. It woke me up. I looked out the window and I get a spotlight in my face, that says, “There’s people upstairs,” and then I hear all this yelling. The nursery was right next to my room. I run in to Katie because I don’t know what’s going on. Pat runs into the room and says, “Cathy, the cops are here.” And I’m going like, “What do you mean the cops are here?” And the attic door was in the baby’s room. It was an old farmhouse. And I didn’t realize at the time what he was doing, but he went up in the attic real quick and ran back down. And of course by that time, the police were at us, in the house, gun point, all that. As soon as they found the pound of marijuana, they quit looking. They didn’t look for nothing else. They found it up in the attic because that’s where Pat had taken it because there was other weed in the house they didn’t find because they quit looking. And of course, we were arrested. That was with a pound of marijuana in 1974 by the Worcester County sheriff’s department that did not belong to us. We never heard from the informant again. He never called the next day to say, “I’m coming to get the pound of marijuana.” He never called the day after to say, “Are you okay? What happened? Where’s my weed?” We never heard from the man again. Taya Graham: So her husband, a veteran who served his country, and an EMT who dedicated his life to saving others, was accused of being a drug dealer and was facing a lengthy prison sentence, as you can see in this newspaper clip here. The mainstream media embraced this narrative. It was a debilitating turn of events for the whole family. But for Freeman, there was also the coincidence of the man who showed up their house, left his belongings, and then never returned. Could it be that the strange sequence of events was simply happenstance? Was it simply a string of bad luck that brought those two events together? Let’s listen to Catherine explain why she believes there was more to the story. Catherine Freeman: Of course, they charge him with distribution, the whole nine yards. He could’ve gone to jail for a long, long time. Speaker: So they charged him like he was a drug dealer. Catherine Freeman: Yes, right. Speaker: How did this affect him? Catherine Freeman: Well, he’d already had issues from the Vietnam War. I was only 19 and Pat was 28. I’m from Snow Hill. He’d been around the world several times. He was a man of the world to me. So of course, he calls his dad right away and tells him. And then the next thing we know, they want to make a deal. This is what we want you to do. If you want to get out of this, this is what you’ll do. Speaker: What was the deal? Catherine Freeman: Plead guilty to possession, probation, and that Eugene back off of running for sheriff of Wicomico County. And he did not win, and that was the end of his career. And he was a veteran too, a military veteran. And it was awful what they did to him. They were both honest men, Pat and his father, Eugene Carey. And they did not deserve what happened. And that was one of the reasons why I feel I have to say something. It’s not about me, it’s about them. But because he married and he was in Worcester County, that’s what happened to him. Taya Graham: So the message was clear according to Catherine. A drug informant who appeared to be working with the police had entered their lives at a time when her father in law was mounting a campaign for sheriff. The arrest had turned her loving husband into a drug dealer, and mainstream media picked up and ran with that narrative. But that’s now where this story ends. And before I let Catherine tell us what happened next, I’m joined by reporting Partner, Stephen Janis, who has been investigating to give us background. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: First, you researched the arrest of Catherine’s husband. What did you find out? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s really interesting because none of the records are of course available online. You have to go back 50 years. Catherine shared a newspaper article, which I was able to find on a newspaper site. And what’s really interesting about it is that the article itself doesn’t really recount much of what the crime actually was, but it does in the headline emphasize that he is the son of a candidate, and that’s all the article really tells you. And the headline is kind of blaring, and so it gives you the impression that this was possibly a setup because if you look at it, it’s pretty clear that what they wanted to emphasize was not the crime, or the effect, or the impact of the crime, or the severity of the crime, but rather the political affiliation of the person who they were charging. Taya Graham: Now the war on drugs has been a mass casualty event for most of our country. How bad has it been and what do the numbers tell us? Stephen Janis: Well, let’s think about this statistic. According to the American Progress, there is one arrest for a drug possession every 26 seconds in this country. Since the 1970s, the US has spent over $1 trillion on the war on drugs. And the US government, the federal government, spends $3.3 billion a year incarcerating people just for possession. So really, it’s hard not to look at those numbers and say, “This is devastating.” Taya Graham: Now finally, this story reminds me of a concept that you have talked about before, the powerful and destructive legal invention that you call proximity crimes. Can you explain this concept and how it pertains here? Stephen Janis: Well, so many bad cases in the city always started with a simple phrase from police. I had smelled marijuana. And once they smelled marijuana, they can throw out any sort of civil protections any person has. It’s the pretext for all sorts of dominating power when it comes to policing. The possession or the proximity of drugs in any situation gives police license to take your property, take your freedom, do anything really in that situation, and ascribe all sorts of motivations to you, which may or may not be true. So proximity crimes are probably the laziest form of crime developed by our legal system and has facilitated a horrible and costly war on drugs. Taya Graham: Now as I said before, Catherine’s husband faced serious charges. But behind the scenes, a message was sent that it could all go away. But there was a catch, which I will let Catherine explain. Catherine Freeman: Well, his family kind of despised me after that because they kind of felt like if it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have been here. It cost thousands of dollars, the fine and the attorney. Eugene’s career was done. He didn’t do anything in law enforcement anymore. And Pat, he just tried to make the best of it. Taya Graham: And the pain for her was intense, a story so painful, she explained to us why she waited nearly 50 years to tell it. Catherine Freeman: I mean, we were honest people, and they made us look dishonest. Why after 47 years would I sit here and say we weren’t set up if I’m not telling the truth? I’ve had two men in my life that I felt treated badly, and their life was, their careers were ruined. They were veterans, they are veterans, military veterans. And they were accused of things that weren’t true. They were set up. They did nothing wrong. Taya Graham: So as this story points out, and as we’ve said before, policing is not the product of the desire for public safety as law enforcement and politicians often argue. Our idea of a crime is not the extension of some philosophical sense of justice. And even more important, our sense of right and wrong is not the driving force behind a set of laws that can ruin a man’s life over a pound, just a pound, of a weed that grows naturally and provides medical comfort to millions. The story that Catherine Freeman so bravely shared reveals a less scrutinized by more toxic imperative for the proliferation of cops and prisons across this country.

      "Title: Battleground Baltimore: Ghost Guns in Baltimore \n",
      " Author: Jaisal Noor \n",
      " Date: 2021-07-09 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: Earlier this week, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) and US Department of Homeland Security announced the arrests of four men involved in a significant drug dealing operation, boasting that “1200 grams of suspected ecstasy, over 1900 pills of suspected fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, scales for drug distribution, [and] 15 firearms and parts to manufacture 40 additional handguns also known as ghost guns” were seized. The “ghost guns” displayed during the presser were polymer kits—boxes of plastic, unserialized gun parts that can be ordered online by anybody and usually cost between $300-$500. ‘Ghost gun’ is the catchall term for guns that do not have serial numbers (and are untraceable, as a result), that have been privately made, though it most often means guns that have been personally 3D-printed or assembled from a kit. During the press conference for the raid, BPD Commissioner Michael Harrison explained that “[ghost guns] have found themselves in the hands of criminals, prohibited convicted felons, and gun traffickers because they know we cannot track them back to their origin.”  Last month, Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy held a virtual event where Deputy Police Commissioner Sheree Briscoe emphasized the increase in ghost gun seizures and warned of a rise in these untraceable guns. Some of these guns have already been connected to homicides, and more of these guns are being seized by police each year, she explained. “We’re on pace to surpass last year’s numbers and potentially come in between 250 to 300 privately made firearms that will make their way to the streets of Baltimore,” Briscoe said last month. The major talking point, and one repeated the most by local news back in June, was that ghost gun seizures increased by 400% between 2019 and 2020. WBAL wrote, “there’s new evidence to suggest that ghost guns are Baltimore’s newest crime epidemic.” That 400% increase, however, was from just 30 guns to 128 guns—in a city where police officers regularly seize thousands of guns each year. And the increase in ghost guns is hard to convincingly connect to an increase in violent crime. \n",

This is despite the fact that his last extradition resulted in Diab being held for three years in almost solitary confinement while French authorities searched for evidence to convict him, before being cleared of charges and released in 2018. Regardless of that previous verdict, France’s highest court issued a ruling in May that the prosecution team can continue its case against Diab, raising the possibility that Canada may comply once again with the French authorities and send Diab to France to face charges.  \n",

      " Content: Black-Led Community Garden in Cherry Hill Faces Eviction, Poppleton Challenges Developers The remote, deeply segregated Black neighborhood neighborhood of Cherry Hill does not even have a grocery store, but the Cherry Hill Urban Community Garden has been remedying that problem, providing fresh food to a community that has little access to it—and now they’re facing eviction.  Last month, The Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC) issued a notice to vacate the land where Cherry Hill Urban Community Garden exists. People at the Black Yield Institute, who have been running the farm since 2017, have been organizing in opposition to the eviction. Over 30,000 people have signed an online petition opposing the eviction, and Black Yield Institute is holding a rally on July 3, 2021 to call attention to the issue. A spokesperson for the HABC said that the Black Yield Institute never had permission to use the land.  “We cannot overlook the fact that the Black Yield Institute is occupying the land without permission. Our hope is they will be able to relocate and continue their farming elsewhere. Importantly, in keeping with our mission, HABC’s longer-term plans call for building badly needed affordable housing on the property.” The Cherry Hill CDC at one time had a now-expired agreement to use the land in question. A July 8 meeting has been scheduled where the HABC, the Cherry Hill CDC, and the Black Yield Institute will meet to discuss the issue.  Eric Jackson, Servant Director of Black Yield Institute, said it’s unclear why the HABC wants to eviction them now. He said it will only hurt fresh food access in Cherry Hill. “Until there is affordable housing, the land will be unoccupied,” Jackson said. “I don’t see a reason why the people can’t use it for good use. We’re not over here doing vandalism. We’re providing jobs, we’re providing opportunities for young people to learn agriculture, we’re providing opportunities for people to laugh and have joy on this space.” Jaisal Noor, Cameron Granadino and Brandon Soderberg produced this report for Battleground Baltimore this week. .@BlackYield, an urban community garden in the Baltimore neighborhood of Cherry Hill, provides fresh and nutritious food for residents living in a \"food desert.\" Now they face eviction: report by @JaisalNoor pic.twitter.com/CFDyTNl3vd \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Jacobin on June 30, 2021. It is shared here with permission. Donald Rumsfeld just died at the age of 88. Obituaries at outlets like the New York Times and CNN consistently mention the same memorable but pointless bits of trivia. He was America’s youngest secretary of defense (in the Ford administration) and the oldest (in the George W. Bush administration). He wrote so many memos about so many subjects that they came to be known as “snowflakes.” Arriving at the Pentagon in the 1970s, the Times tells us, he became famous for “his one-handed push-ups and his prowess on a squash court.” To see the full absurdity of this, imagine an obituary of Slobodan Milosevic that lingered on innocuous details of his office management style and fondness for soccer, or an obituary of Saddam Hussein that focused on how young he was when he formally became president of Iraq in 1979 and his favorite dessert in his Baghdad palace. \n",

My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable.

Today, we’re going to take a closer look at a phenomenon we’ve examined on the show before: auditing and cop watching. But this cop watcher has a unique perspective, because he’s a former cop. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you.

Now, as you know, if you’ve watched the show before, we have continued to follow a growing phenomenon called “cop watching” or “auditing.” It’s an organic movement of citizen journalists who pick up cell phone cameras and observe police or survey buildings to ensure our elected leaders are protecting the rights of the people.

      " Content: This story first appeared in Jacobin on May 13, 2019, and is shared with permission. “The only band that matters.” There is charismatic hubris in this phrase, a declaration of radical faith. Fuck the past, the future is here and everything in music will be ruthlessly revamped in its wake. And when the description was applied to the Clash, it was easy to believe. Was the band great? We are better off asking what constitutes greatness, or even if the very notion is useful. Today, though, it’s easy to scoff at. Since the death of frontman Joe Strummer in 2002, the Clash have ascended into rock-and-roll mythos. No fewer than 30 books have been released on the band or on Strummer. Some of them are wonderful. Others are shallow and sloppy hagiographies. Their music has been used to hawk everything from boots to smartphones. Centrists in progressive clothing like Beto O’Rourke receive high praise for quoting “The Clampdown” to Ted Cruz. Separating what’s commodity and spectacle from the band’s actual contribution is getting harder. \n",

      " Content: Shortly after our story aired on how police put LA resident Daniel Alvarez in handcuffs for a bogus traffic violation, he was pulled over again for allegedly switching lanes without signaling. In this episode of PAR, we explore the continued use of questionable traffic stops to harass people like Daniel, and what these troubling tactics say about the state of American policing across the country. Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And today we have a breaking development on a story that we told you about just two weeks ago, when we highlighted the case of Daniel Alvarez. Daniel was pulled over by a Los Angeles sheriff under false pretenses, as this video here shows. Well, over the weekend, Daniel was pulled over again, and the video he made of the stop is just as shocking as the first. But, before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at PAR@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And of course you can always message me directly at @TayasBaltimore on Twitter and Facebook, and please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us. And now we have a Patreon account called Police Accountability Report, so if you have a few dollars to spare, it would really help us keep doing these investigations for you. Investigations that the mainstream media just won’t do. So check for the link pinned in the comments below. Okay. Now we finally got that out of the way. Now, as you may recall, two weeks ago we reported on this January 2020 traffic stop involving Los Angeles resident, Daniel Alvarez. He was pulled over by a Los Angeles County sheriff, who said he had pulled across a line preceding a stop sign. Not that he’d driven past the stop sign without stopping, mind you. He just didn’t stop far enough away from it. And for this heinous crime, Daniel was put in handcuffs and the passenger of his car was arrested. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Daniel Alvarez: Cause you want to see what I look like. Be a man and say what you’re stopping me for, then. Sheriff: I already did. [crosstalk 00:01:49] and everything. Daniel Alvarez: I didn’t break no law. Speaker: I’m talking to his mom. Sheriff: Okay, off the phone. Speaker: This is ridiculous. Sheriff: Okay, here. Speaker: What? Why do I have to- Sheriff: I’m not stopping your recording or anything. Speaker: No, you have no reason to get my phone. Sheriff: I do, all right? Speaker: We didn’t even do anything. Sheriff: All right, step out of the vehicle. Speaker: What is this for? Sheriff: [inaudible 00:02:06]. Don’t reach for anything. [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Taya Graham: We spoke to Daniel about that January 2020 incident, and he told us he had been profiled by the sheriff. And he says he has proof. That’s because unbeknownst to the police, the person with Alvarez recorded the police searching the car. What she captured shows an officer mocking Alvarez, and even using an expletive to describe him. Let’s listen. [VIDEO CLIP BEGINS] Sheriff: Law abiding citizens. Fuck that guy. [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] \n",

During the early fall of 2017, just three days before the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division would descend on the Alabama prison system to investigate reports of brutality and sexual violence, an atrocious incident occurred at the Bibb Correctional Facility’s Hot Bay, a dormitory “housing men in bunkbeds multiple rows deep,” as the DOJ would write in its subsequent report. In the back of the room, two prisoners repeatedly stabbed their victim, and when another prisoner attempted to stop the assault he became the next victim. In a desperate struggle to stay alive, the initial victim “dragged himself to the front doors of the dormitory,” the DOJ later wrote, where other prisoners banged on the locked doors to summon the guards. By the time a correctional officer finally arrived, the victim was dead on the prison floor, having bled out from his open wounds. One prisoner witness offered the haunting testimony to the DOJ that “he could still hear the prisoner’s screams in his sleep.” Numerous other prisoners reported that rapes, torture, and physical assaults are routine. Despite the atrocity of such violence, it is not an isolated happening: The DOJ report concluded that “an excessive amount of violence, sexual abuse, and prisoner deaths occur within Alabama’s prisons on a regular basis.” \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Junputh on May 10, 2021, and is shared with permission via the Progressive International’s Wire. It is translated from Hindi by Mohit Sachdeva. The continuing farmers’ protests on the borders of India’s national capital Delhi demanding the repeal of the three Farm Bills have been hailed as the most valiant resistance. However, in particular, it is the large participation of women that is unprecedented. The ordinances being passed by the BJP-led majority government without any parliamentary opposition have made ordinary women leave the confines of the four walls to hit the streets. More importantly, women’s messages are becoming sharper each time. This is evident in their reactions to the Supreme Court’s intervention on Jan. 11 (why are women “kept” in these protests and that they should be “persuaded” to return) in the form of numerous rebuttals both on the stage of the protests and in hundreds of interviews to national and international media. It’s not easy to say who these women are, what drives them to the protest, and exactly when their spark of resistance was lit to reach Singhu or Tikri. Even so, they are in the protest with all their resilience and keeping the protests vibrant. The ongoing farmers’ protests amply demonstrate that the word “farmer” means an entire community: women, men, elderly, and the youth. And it is a collective struggle of food producers, land owners or landless. And hence, there is no individual producer that state and capital can buy in trickery or in appeasement. \n",

COVID-19 and Vaccination Inequity The year began with all of us still very much in the grips of COVID-19. The fight this year was not just to stop the spread of the potentially deadly disease, but over how soon we should resume elements of normal life that the pandemic interrupted.  The Baltimore Teachers Union pushed back as school administrators looked to reopen in-person education during the pandemic. Corey Gaber, The Baltimore Teachers Union’s Elementary School Vice President, told us that the union has always been firm that in-person learning should only happen when it’s as safe as possible for students and teachers. “We should not be expanding learning in-person, until it’s safe,” Gaber said. “And we have some very specific ideas of what safety looks like. And they know that we believe they’re nowhere close to meeting those standards, not just our own standards, but their stated standards for what should be in place before moving to in-person learning.”  \n",

      " Content: This story first appeared in Jacobin on June 7, 2021, and is shared with permission. INTERVIEW BY:Cale Brooks is Jacobin’s video editor.Nando Vila is the cohost of Weekends. In 1988, Chileans voted to end General Augusto Pinochet’s military dictatorship. But despite popular hopes, the transition to democracy left key parts of his regime intact, including a constitution that enshrined neoliberalism and elite control in the political system. It did so by requiring a supermajority in both houses of congress to make large-scale reforms to the economic or political system and establishing an electoral regime that rewarded virtually all seats to the top two parties or coalitions. In the decades that followed the transition, power has traded between a center-right and center-left that have both managed the system effectively handed to them by the Pinochet regime without making any fundamental changes. During this time, Chile has seen immense economic growth, but it has been heavily concentrated in the hands of the rich while workers have faced more and more economic insecurity. In the fall of 2019, this helped spark mass protest, first against an increase in metro fare prices, but then into a larger rebellion demanding an end to austerity, neoliberalism, and the fundamentally antidemocratic political system. The unrest forced the government to organize a plebiscite on whether or not to rewrite the Chilean constitution and the method to do so. With a sharp uptick of voter participation, 80% of those voting in the plebiscite chose to overturn the Pinochet constitution and to have an elected Constituent Assembly write the new one. Recent delegate elections to the Constituent Assembly were a devastating blow to traditional political elites and demonstrate new openings for a resurgent left. Jacobin’s Nando Vila and Cale Brooks sat down with René Rojas as part of Jacobin’s YouTube show Weekends to discuss the recent developments in Chile and the path forward for the Left. Rojas is a sociologist who teaches at Binghamton University. His research is on neoliberal development and politics in Latin America, where he spent years as an activist. CB: Explain to us what’s going on in Chile. RR: I imagine you’re referring specifically to the latest elections, which were held on May 15 and 16. Chileans were electing delegates to a Constituent Assembly to redraft the country’s constitution. There were also local and gubernatorial elections. For the first time, there were provincial elections in Chile. A veritable earthquake has shattered the foundations of the old political regime in Chile. Most of the attention has been paid, correctly so, to the outcome of the constituent elections and the very fact that these elections were held in the first place. The best way to describe what occurred is a veritable earthquake that has shattered the foundations of the old political regime in Chile. This is the regime that emerged out of the dictatorship in the post-authoritarian transition in 1988 and ’89 and that ruled over Chile ever since, primarily under center-left governments. What these elections have done has been to shatter the old partisan political system and open, for the first time in over four decades, the possibility of more substantive democratic reform in the country. NV: Mark Fisher talks about the assassination of Salvador Allende in Chile as the opening salvo of the neoliberal era. For many decades in places like the Economist, Chile has been held up as a model of a free-market economy and just how well everything goes, and a decent place to live, etc. Is that picture an accurate one? Do the free-market reforms, the ones that Chile is famous for, create a decent, healthy society where everyone is happy? RR: That’s fundamentally what was at play here and what was in question during these elections. And not just this round of elections. Chile has been going through a cycle of mass mobilization and rejection of this model for about the past ten years, and it really intensified and exploded in October 2019.  \n",

This case is about Mississippi’s “heartbeat” ban that among other restrictions, outlaws abortion as early as six weeks, or before most people know they are pregnant. This is the first abortion case the Court has taken since the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, who has expressed extreme anti-choice views and has ties to anti-choice groups. It is also the first time that the Supreme Court has looked at a pre-viability abortion ban since Roe v. Wade in 1973. If Roe is overturned, 24 states and three territories will likely immediately have abortion overturned within their borders.   \n",

The case of this beleaguered Baltimore businessman provides a stark example of our criminal justice system’s lack of equity as he has had his store raided on multiple occasions for selling legal products provided in stores online and elsewhere in the city. We also speak to James Gibson, who spent 29 years in prison after being brutalized, burned, and tortured by Chicago’s Commander John Burge and his infamous “midnight crew,” a group of officers who violated the civil liberties of citizens and committed acts of violence. Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And to achieve this goal today, we’re going to explore two cases that expose just how unjust that system is, first by revisiting a case of a business owner who has been harassed by police, and is now entangled in a questionable federal investigation that has ruined his life. Then, by talking to a man who spent 29 years in prison after giving a false confession to Chicago police after he was tortured by them. But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. And of course, you can always message me directly at Taya’s Baltimore on Facebook or Twitter. And please like, share, and comment on our videos. It really does help us, and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. Okay, we’ve got that out of the way. \n",

      " Content: Last month at Baltimore City’s annual Taxpayer’s Night event, where residents show up and express their excitement—and more often anger—about the city’s proposed budget, nearly 80 Baltimoreans got on the (virtual) microphone and told Mayor Brandon Scott that the 2022 budget’s proposed $28 million increase to the Baltimore Police Department’s already massive budget was unacceptable. Those who spoke up at Taxpayer’s Night were surprisingly diverse, coming from neighborhoods such as Upton and Park Heights—some of the least safe and most divested communities in the majority Black city—as well as Hampden, a “quirky,” 88% white tourist spot known for its John Waters-influenced HonFest, and Patterson Park, where many of the city’s medical professionals working at nearby Johns Hopkins Hospital put down roots. This call to “defund” countered some of the most frequent criticisms of the defund movement: That it is a minority opinion made louder by, say, Black radicals and white anarchists disconnected from the daily fears “regular” residents face in a city that regularly reaches 300-plus homicides. The reason for this mass call to defund BPD is twofold. \n",

      " Author: Jaisal Noor \n",
      " Date: 2021-05-06 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: Jaisal Noor: The coronavirus now has one in four Americans living in lockdown.Almost 100,000 small businesses permanently closed since the pandemic. Vinny Green: We lost 70% of all our accounts. Jaisal Noor: When the pandemic hit, Baltimore rallied behind Taharka Brothers Ice Cream. Detric McCoy: Baltimore, Maryland, saved Taharka Brothers tenfold. And I love that the city did that for us. And you know, I believe they did that because of what we do here. Jaisal Noor: At the majority Black-owned Taharka Brothers, it’s about more than just ice cream. Detric McCoy: You got guys all from poor neighborhoods, right, and we probably should die according to the statistics. But because we have an opportunity to become owners and some of us are owners, that we appreciate our lives, we appreciate our jobs. Jaisal Noor: Launched in 2010, Taharka Brothers gained popularity by empowering young men of color with decent paying jobs and leadership building opportunities making ice cream. After a lengthy transition in December of 2020, Taharka Brothers became just the latest local business to convert to worker ownership. Vinny Green: We have some of the young guys in here, Deon and Kevin, they are managers in the kitchen, they help produce all the ice cream and help create a lot of the flavors and we have flavor committees where the team can come up with a lot of different amazing flavors… Worker co-ops, it changed the solution so much, giving the gratitude that the employees can actually feel ownership, to know their hard work does not go unnoticed. And then it makes you want to do better for yourself no matter what, whatever the obstacle is set around your surroundings. Jaisal Noor: Working at a co-op won’t make you wealthy overnight. Detric McCoy: Everyone always thinks it makes everyone rich. That’s not the case. Jaisal Noor: And it’s often more demanding than a typical job. Detric McCoy: Everyone still has to work really hard to get what you want, what you think you deserve. You know, just because I’m a owner doesn’t mean I’m riding in flashy cars. There’s six owners, and it’s more of a responsibility. Jaisal Noor: In industries rife with low pay and harsh working conditions, co-ops offer democratic workplaces and often better pay and benefits. Taharka Brothers’ 14 workers who are not owners take part in profit sharing, and are offered a path to ownership. Detric McCoy: We have an advantage of treating everyone fair, you know, and that comes out in our product, which is why I believe our product is so good because we give everyone an opportunity to become an owner, to speak their mind, be a part of committees, go out and get education, get healthcare, things like that. It really makes them feel like ‘Oh man, I gotta make each pint so special. Each tub of ice cream that goes to any restaurant or wherever it goes, it’s going to be the best tub is also going to have my name on it.’ And it does. Jaisal Noor: So when the pandemic brought hardship, the workers were ready to adapt. Vinny Green: We lost 70% of all our accounts. We had to make a business pivot. We started a home delivery system, which kept the business alive. Without home deliveries, a lot of our guys would have lost their jobs. Jaisal Noor: It wasn’t easy to uproot their entire business model. Vinny Green: It literally was just all hands on deck. All the owners are doing deliveries late at night, coming in the morning early to put all the pints up in the freezer, or just be able to give an extra hand with packing orders or giving assistance wherever it’s needed. Jaisal Noor: That Taharka Brothers survived a pandemic that laid ruin to so many other small businesses like theirs offers insight into a bigger trend. Although comprehensive data is not yet available, a survey of 140 co-ops across the country suggests that instead of simply closing down, co-ops were able to harness their collective decision-making to adapt their businesses and avoid layoffs. But collective decision-making—at Taharka Brothers, each of the six worker-owners has voting power—can also limit how quickly a co-op can act. Vinny Green: We make all our decisions as a group. And we all try to make decisions that we can all benefit out of, that we all can agree on, and all think that it’s the right decision for all of us. Detric McCoy: But the hardest part of it is probably trying to do things in a timely fashion. Especially when we’re in a flavor committee and we’re just sitting back eating ice cream for a couple hours. Jaisal Noor: But the biggest limitation co-ops face is a lack of access to capital. Racist public policies robbed Black communities of wealth and wealth building opportunities for generations, and co-ops typically don’t qualify for bank loans because they require collateral or personal guarantees that are incompatible with the cooperative structure. For years, Taharka Brothers struggled to raise investment. In 2013, they resorted to crowdfunding to raise money for a new ice cream truck. Devon Brown: We’re trying to launch this food truck for our Vehicles for Change truck and we need your help to make it happen, to take our business to the next level. Vinny Green: Taharka Brothers’ ice cream is handcrafted, so we’re gonna handcraft this truck. Yeah, we’re gonna paint this whole truck electric pink, just like my shirt, Taharka Brothers. Jaisal Noor: They hit their fundraising goal, but needed a more sustainable model. So in 2016 when their ice cream truck broke down, they received a $15,000 loan from BRED or the Baltimore Roundtable for Economic Democracy, a then brand new organization just launched to provide local co-ops with technical and financial assistance unavailable anywhere else. Detric McCoy: They let us know how it works to be a co-op, what things do you have to do? What’s going to be different from becoming, from worker to now owner, making budgets for your department, helping us out with loans for specific, more equipment or more marketing things. Jaisal Noor: BRED is part of Seed Commons, a $25 million loan fund that spans 26 cities. Kate Khatib: So we don’t take personal guarantees. We don’t look at personal credit. We don’t take collateral interests in businesses other than the equipment that’s purchased with the loans. Jaisal Noor: This helps co-ops become more sustainable, and gives them structures that help them weather crises. None of the 60 co-ops that Seed Commons currently lends to have closed permanently due to the pandemic. Kate Khatib: And that’s not to say that those businesses haven’t had to shut down, it’s not to say that workers haven’t been temporarily laid off, but it is the case that every single one of those businesses that we’ve invested in has found a way to pivot, has found a way to come back from the pandemic, is continuing to operate, is continuing to provide that access to quality, sustainable jobs with dignity. Jaisal Noor: A 2015 Harvard study ranked Baltimore among the worst cities in terms of social mobility for African American youth. Two out of three Black Baltimore residents face liquid asset poverty. And African Americans continue to face massive wealth and income gaps and disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration. Co-ops alone can’t fix this. But worker-owners say they can be part of the solution. Detric McCoy: I think it would definitely help our community, especially here in Baltimore, if people have something that they can work for, and that they own, and that they can appreciate, but if there were more worker co-ops, I believe there would be more people to you know, fighting for what they believe in and the violence and everything will probably come down a fair amount. Jaisal Noor: This story was supported by a grant from Solutions Journalism Network, and is part of a series exploring how co-ops across the country have weathered COVID-19. With Cameron Granadino, this is Jaisal Noor. Taharka Brothers is about more than just ice cream. They are a worker-run business that provides living-wage jobs, leadership, and wealth-building opportunities to young people of color in a city that offers few pathways to success. So when the pandemic hit, they were ready to pivot their business model, and stayed running at a time when so many others were forced to close permanently.

      " Content: Jaisal Noor: The coronavirus now has one in four Americans living in lockdown.Almost 100,000 small businesses permanently closed since the pandemic. Vinny Green: We lost 70% of all our accounts. Jaisal Noor: When the pandemic hit, Baltimore rallied behind Taharka Brothers Ice Cream. Detric McCoy: Baltimore, Maryland, saved Taharka Brothers tenfold. And I love that the city did that for us. And you know, I believe they did that because of what we do here. Jaisal Noor: At the majority Black-owned Taharka Brothers, it’s about more than just ice cream. Detric McCoy: You got guys all from poor neighborhoods, right, and we probably should die according to the statistics. But because we have an opportunity to become owners and some of us are owners, that we appreciate our lives, we appreciate our jobs. Jaisal Noor: Launched in 2010, Taharka Brothers gained popularity by empowering young men of color with decent paying jobs and leadership building opportunities making ice cream. After a lengthy transition in December of 2020, Taharka Brothers became just the latest local business to convert to worker ownership. Vinny Green: We have some of the young guys in here, Deon and Kevin, they are managers in the kitchen, they help produce all the ice cream and help create a lot of the flavors and we have flavor committees where the team can come up with a lot of different amazing flavors… Worker co-ops, it changed the solution so much, giving the gratitude that the employees can actually feel ownership, to know their hard work does not go unnoticed. And then it makes you want to do better for yourself no matter what, whatever the obstacle is set around your surroundings. Jaisal Noor: Working at a co-op won’t make you wealthy overnight. Detric McCoy: Everyone always thinks it makes everyone rich. That’s not the case. Jaisal Noor: And it’s often more demanding than a typical job. Detric McCoy: Everyone still has to work really hard to get what you want, what you think you deserve. You know, just because I’m a owner doesn’t mean I’m riding in flashy cars. There’s six owners, and it’s more of a responsibility. Jaisal Noor: In industries rife with low pay and harsh working conditions, co-ops offer democratic workplaces and often better pay and benefits. Taharka Brothers’ 14 workers who are not owners take part in profit sharing, and are offered a path to ownership. Detric McCoy: We have an advantage of treating everyone fair, you know, and that comes out in our product, which is why I believe our product is so good because we give everyone an opportunity to become an owner, to speak their mind, be a part of committees, go out and get education, get healthcare, things like that. It really makes them feel like ‘Oh man, I gotta make each pint so special. Each tub of ice cream that goes to any restaurant or wherever it goes, it’s going to be the best tub is also going to have my name on it.’ And it does. Jaisal Noor: So when the pandemic brought hardship, the workers were ready to adapt. Vinny Green: We lost 70% of all our accounts. We had to make a business pivot. We started a home delivery system, which kept the business alive. Without home deliveries, a lot of our guys would have lost their jobs. Jaisal Noor: It wasn’t easy to uproot their entire business model. Vinny Green: It literally was just all hands on deck. All the owners are doing deliveries late at night, coming in the morning early to put all the pints up in the freezer, or just be able to give an extra hand with packing orders or giving assistance wherever it’s needed. Jaisal Noor: That Taharka Brothers survived a pandemic that laid ruin to so many other small businesses like theirs offers insight into a bigger trend. Although comprehensive data is not yet available, a survey of 140 co-ops across the country suggests that instead of simply closing down, co-ops were able to harness their collective decision-making to adapt their businesses and avoid layoffs. But collective decision-making—at Taharka Brothers, each of the six worker-owners has voting power—can also limit how quickly a co-op can act. Vinny Green: We make all our decisions as a group. And we all try to make decisions that we can all benefit out of, that we all can agree on, and all think that it’s the right decision for all of us. Detric McCoy: But the hardest part of it is probably trying to do things in a timely fashion. Especially when we’re in a flavor committee and we’re just sitting back eating ice cream for a couple hours. Jaisal Noor: But the biggest limitation co-ops face is a lack of access to capital. Racist public policies robbed Black communities of wealth and wealth building opportunities for generations, and co-ops typically don’t qualify for bank loans because they require collateral or personal guarantees that are incompatible with the cooperative structure. For years, Taharka Brothers struggled to raise investment. In 2013, they resorted to crowdfunding to raise money for a new ice cream truck. Devon Brown: We’re trying to launch this food truck for our Vehicles for Change truck and we need your help to make it happen, to take our business to the next level. Vinny Green: Taharka Brothers’ ice cream is handcrafted, so we’re gonna handcraft this truck. Yeah, we’re gonna paint this whole truck electric pink, just like my shirt, Taharka Brothers. Jaisal Noor: They hit their fundraising goal, but needed a more sustainable model. So in 2016 when their ice cream truck broke down, they received a $15,000 loan from BRED or the Baltimore Roundtable for Economic Democracy, a then brand new organization just launched to provide local co-ops with technical and financial assistance unavailable anywhere else. Detric McCoy: They let us know how it works to be a co-op, what things do you have to do? What’s going to be different from becoming, from worker to now owner, making budgets for your department, helping us out with loans for specific, more equipment or more marketing things. Jaisal Noor: BRED is part of Seed Commons, a $25 million loan fund that spans 26 cities. Kate Khatib: So we don’t take personal guarantees. We don’t look at personal credit. We don’t take collateral interests in businesses other than the equipment that’s purchased with the loans. Jaisal Noor: This helps co-ops become more sustainable, and gives them structures that help them weather crises. None of the 60 co-ops that Seed Commons currently lends to have closed permanently due to the pandemic. Kate Khatib: And that’s not to say that those businesses haven’t had to shut down, it’s not to say that workers haven’t been temporarily laid off, but it is the case that every single one of those businesses that we’ve invested in has found a way to pivot, has found a way to come back from the pandemic, is continuing to operate, is continuing to provide that access to quality, sustainable jobs with dignity. Jaisal Noor: A 2015 Harvard study ranked Baltimore among the worst cities in terms of social mobility for African American youth. Two out of three Black Baltimore residents face liquid asset poverty. And African Americans continue to face massive wealth and income gaps and disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration. Co-ops alone can’t fix this. But worker-owners say they can be part of the solution. Detric McCoy: I think it would definitely help our community, especially here in Baltimore, if people have something that they can work for, and that they own, and that they can appreciate, but if there were more worker co-ops, I believe there would be more people to you know, fighting for what they believe in and the violence and everything will probably come down a fair amount.

Big Tech has big power over freedom of expression—and that is a big problem.  Over the last several months, it has become quite apparent that Facebook and Twitter exercise an inordinate amount of control over the news and ideas we are exposed to. In the wake of the Capitol Hill riots by the far right, Big Tech companies took the unprecedented step of deplatforming the sitting president of the United States and ramping up their powers of censorship. This is not simply an issue of artificial intelligence and content filters in need of refinement, but about the political values that shape the question of acceptable speech. Now, no one should feel bad for Donald Trump or the far right. But the increased powers nakedly wielded by Big Tech companies are a major cause for concern for the left. Those of us who are engaged in political struggles that seek to upend the structures of racism, imperialism, and inequality often are advocating ideas outside the mainstream—a term which powerful Big Tech companies increasingly define. Thus, a crackdown on political expression that seeks to reign in ill-defined “extremism” inevitably means attacking the political expression of those who challenge existing power structures in our society. And this is a very dangerous thing.  The ways in which news is being consumed is changing. Gone are the days where print publications and cable television dominate and drive the news cycle. Newspapers have long been in decline, but even in the last four years newspaper consumption has taken a nosedive. A recent survey showed that in 2016, 20% of Americans “often” got their news from newspapers, while in 2020 that number was down to 10% (with only 5% preferring newspapers over other media). Television news consumption has also fallen, with 40% of Americans in 2020 saying they “often” got their news from TV, down from 57% percent in 2016.  News consumed online, either via social media or through search engines or news websites, is now the dominant form of news consumption: 86% of respondents said they often or sometimes consume news via smartphones, computers, or tablets. News apps and websites, along with online searches, are the number one way in which people get their news online, but social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter make up a growing share of how people consume their news. 53% of surveyed adults in the U.S. often or sometimes get their news via social media.

      " Content: The horrifying body camera footage of Chico, California, police killing 31-year-old Tyler Rushing is another troubling example of why police violence is not a problem limited to urban communities. As part of PAR’s continuing coverage, we examine Rushing’s death in the context of the broader phenomena of rural overpolicing and the persistent use of unwarranted violence by law enforcement across the country. Taya Graham:        Hello, my name is Taya Graham and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear from the start, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the underlying system that makes bad policing possible, and today we’re going to deliver on this promise by examining the death of a young man at the hands of police, that all started with the decision by a private security guard to use deadly force, a decision to draw a gun by a person without a badge, which raises troubling questions about how deadly force is used in this country and how systemic it has become without proper scrutiny. Before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com, and we might be able to investigate for you. Of course, you can always message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Facebook or Twitter, and please like share and comment on our videos. It really does help us and you know I read your comments and appreciate them. Now, as you know, this show has continued to cover phenomenon that the mainstream media often ignores: over-policing in rural communities. It’s a topic that we discuss often because of the work of many activists and citizen journalists who expose the excesses of police in small communities across the country, and it is often overlooked. That’s why when a viewer reached out to us about the shooting and killing of his son by police in Butte, California, we gave him the chance to share his story. What he told us was not just disturbing, but also raises troubling questions about the number of police killings in this rural California county and what needs to be done to hold police accountable. \n",

      " Content: With so much disinformation floating around, and with so many media outlets filtering their coverage through the geopolitical interests of the West, it’s often difficult for interested audiences to know just what is going on in Russian politics today. From the COVID-19 pandemic to mass protests and the return of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in January, who suffered a near-fatal poisoning attack this summer, major political and economic shifts are taking place in Russia. Add to that the public outcry against the imprisonment of Navalny, who is now on a hunger strike from his prison cell just outside of Moscow, and the new sanctions against Russia that U.S. President Joe Biden announced this week, challenges to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s grip on power are mounting. But what do these developments mean and look like for people on the ground in Russia? In this special production of The Real News Network, new contributor Radhika Desai helps audiences in the West navigate these and other thorny questions. Radhika directs the Geopolitical Economy Research Group, teaches at the University of Manitoba, and is known for proposing the Geopolitical Economy framework for understanding world affairs. In this important and timely conversation for The Real News, Radhika speaks with world-renowned Russian sociologist and activist Boris Kagarlitsky about Putin’s power system, Navalny’s return, and the coming tectonic shifts in Russian politics. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.  Radhika Desai: Boris Kagarlitsky is a very well-known leftist writer, historian, sociologist, and also a political activist in Russia. He has been politically active since the time when the Soviet Union still existed and has continued to do so in Russia, offering a distinctive left perspective on Russian politics. Welcome, Boris, it’s really a great privilege to have you.  This interview has been occasioned by all the discussion about Russian politics in the Western countries with the return of Alexei Navalny to Russia. So, let me start by asking you: What was the political situation in Russia at the time of Navalny’s return in January, 2021? Boris Kagarlitsky: Let’s start with the COVID crisis (I think this is an essential problem for every major capitalist country now—or every major country on Earth, actually). It is very important to understand that Russia has already experienced about six years of economic stagnation. Sometimes it’s accompanied with very, very modest growth, sometimes economic decline. But anyhow, the economy is stagnating for the seventh year in a row. Then the pandemic started, and in that sense Russia is very special, because in terms of providing economic support for the population, the Russian government has been absolutely specific about following a strategy of no support, ever—the idea being that the population should survive on its own. So, on the one hand, they have closed down quite a few businesses and practices, and lots and lots of people have lost their jobs. Even more people, actually, lost their income.  The actual loss of jobs was not that catastrophic in the long run, because quite a few migrant workers had to be thrown out of Russia. So, while the total loss of jobs was impressive, the actual loss of jobs for Russian citizens was not that catastrophic; a lot of that price had to be paid by people in Central Asia, by the immigrant and migrant workers who lost their jobs. Actually (this is very interesting), it ended up creating a kind of division between those who wanted to remain as immigrants and would do whatever they could to stay over, and those who made the personal decision to leave Russia and had to figure out strategies for getting back home. So, in that sense, I think the immigrant population we have now is mainly composed of people who are really loyal to Russia, at least economically—these are people who decided they have to stay in Russia no matter what.  The loss of jobs led to the increase of unemployment. But in terms of Russian citizens, or in terms of people who are actually staying in the country, it was bad, but not that bad. However, in terms of loss of income, it was a real disaster, because most businesses survived at the cost of decreasing salaries. For self-employed businessmen, they had to survive in terms of diminishing their income and diminishing their consumption. So, in that sense, we have a real catastrophe, which was very seriously understood by people as a catastrophe—it’s not only statistics, it’s a real experience.  At the same time, we had a lockdown that was probably not as severe as in many other countries, but its social consequences still must be understood and considered, because I think they will show up for quite a long time. The damage will be really long term—it’s more than just a one-time thing. As I told you before, the Russian government has chosen a kind of “third way” of handling the pandemic: not like Sweden or Belrus, which avoided lockdowns to save the economy, but not like Germany, Canada, or other countries, which sacrificed some elements of the economy but supported the population during the lockdown. The Russian third way was: “We are not supporting the economy or the people.”  You see, the major fear of the Russian government and Putin’s entourage is that there will be a split within the elite … You have to keep the elite united at whatever price. Even if you have to sacrifice the economy and the people, it’s okay, because as long as you have the elite more or less united, stability is guaranteed. That doesn’t mean that Russian leaders were crazy, though, because there was an enormous amount of support given to big corporations, both private ones and those considered to be state owned (actually, they are joint-stock companies with some percentage of the shares owned by the state. In fact, these are also private corporations, but linked to the state, like the paraestatales in Latin America in the 1970s). These big corporations have gotten an enormous amount of support, both in terms of direct support with money given to them and in terms of cheap credits and tax benefits given to them by the government. Russia gives more tax benefits to big corporations than any other major economy does in terms of the percentage of the state budget, which is actually lost to these benefits. It’s absolutely pathetic. So, that was the general policy: It was very much about supporting the oligarchy at the cost of not supporting anybody else. Radhika Desai: One would presume that there was a certain perception of this and an increasing dissatisfaction with the Putin government? Boris Kagarlitsky: That’s exactly the point. And, ironically, in a certain way, it did work. You see, the major fear of the Russian government and Putin’s entourage is that there will be a split within the elite. That kind of split or division was typical in the 1990s, and it was typical for Ukraine. Preventing that split is not only about some kind of class egoism (though that’s also true); it’s also a kind of political strategy. You have to keep the elite united at whatever price. Even if you have to sacrifice the economy and the people, it’s okay, because as long as you have the elite more or less united, stability is guaranteed. Once you destroy this unity of the ruling elite, then you end up like Ukraine, or like Russia in the 1990s.  \n",

For nearly the entirety of the past year, amid a deadly pandemic, warehouse workers and organizers with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) have rallied to attempt a historical feat: To create the first official Amazon union in the United States, which would represent around 5,800 workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer. The votes have been cast; now we wait for the results. With the support of the RWDSU, these warehouse employees, 75-80% of whom are Black, have pushed back against the unsafe and unfair working conditions that have become synonymous with Amazon’s business. But the worker-led unionization effort has also highlighted the ways such conditions have come to define more broadly many sectors of labor in the South. In a country where labor law has been systematically designed to favor the bosses and to make it exceedingly difficult for workers to unionize, the mere fact that Amazon workers in Bessemer have made it to this point is remarkable. But workers and organizers on the ground have also had to combat a pervasive anti-union and anti-worker culture that has been built up over decades, even centuries—a culture that has made it possible for companies like Amazon to weaponize a multitude of misguided narratives about what unions do and how Southern workers should feel about them. Regardless of the eventual outcome, though, the people behind the Amazon union drive have made significant advances in the ideological and rhetorical battle against a longstanding anti-union culture that, until recently, seemed stubbornly unshakeable. Just as these workers represent a new chapter in the struggle for labor rights in the South, Amazon’s countermeasures evoke the ugly, repressive history of anti-worker politics that has dominated in Southern states for generations, including a concerted and sustained campaign to misinform workers and the broader public about organized labor. Every step of the way, while its warehouse workers fought to secure a fair union election, Amazon has sought to capitalize on that repressive history. If the union vote in Bessemer is successful, it will no doubt have tremendous implications for the labor movement in the South and beyond.

For nearly the entirety of the past year, amid a deadly pandemic, warehouse workers and organizers with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) have rallied to attempt a historical feat: To create the first official Amazon union in the United States, which would represent around 5,800 workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer. The votes have been cast; now we wait for the results. With the support of the RWDSU, these warehouse employees, 75-80% of whom are Black, have pushed back against the unsafe and unfair working conditions that have become synonymous with Amazon’s business. But the worker-led unionization effort has also highlighted the ways such conditions have come to define more broadly many sectors of labor in the South. In a country where labor law has been systematically designed to favor the bosses and to make it exceedingly difficult for workers to unionize, the mere fact that Amazon workers in Bessemer have made it to this point is remarkable. But workers and organizers on the ground have also had to combat a pervasive anti-union and anti-worker culture that has been built up over decades, even centuries—a culture that has made it possible for companies like Amazon to weaponize a multitude of misguided narratives about what unions do and how Southern workers should feel about them. Regardless of the eventual outcome, though, the people behind the Amazon union drive have made significant advances in the ideological and rhetorical battle against a longstanding anti-union culture that, until recently, seemed stubbornly unshakeable. Just as these workers represent a new chapter in the struggle for labor rights in the South, Amazon’s countermeasures evoke the ugly, repressive history of anti-worker politics that has dominated in Southern states for generations, including a concerted and sustained campaign to misinform workers and the broader public about organized labor. Every step of the way, while its warehouse workers fought to secure a fair union election, Amazon has sought to capitalize on that repressive history. If the union vote in Bessemer is successful, it will no doubt have tremendous implications for the labor movement in the South and beyond. Regardless of the eventual outcome, though, the people behind the Amazon union drive have made significant advances in the ideological and rhetorical battle against a longstanding anti-union culture that, until recently, seemed stubbornly unshakeable. \n",

      " Content: This story originally appeared in Ms. magazine on Mar. 29, 2021, and is shared with permission from Ms. On the afternoon of Monday, March 22, there was a mass shooting at my neighborhood grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. I was still grappling with the tragic shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, just days before. My initial response was emotional and complicated, because to grow up in Colorado is to know mass gun violence. Its devastating effects reach at least as far back into Colorado history as the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864. More than once since the mass shooting in an Aurora movie theater in 2012, I have had to leave a crowded cinema before the end of the film because I felt unsafe. It was the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that launched my hometown of Littleton, Colorado, into international infamy. I can remember at least three gun-related lockdowns at my schools. One time in high school, I was excused from class to meet my family away from home, because a troubled person suffering from a severe mental health crisis claimed to have obtained a gun and said that he planned to shoot us. Over the years, I have continued to heal psychologically and evolve politically. Today, even as I grieve with my community, I can offer an explanation of how mass gun violence is important to feminism and why women who stand for social equality, in all our diversity, must alchemize our sorrow and rage into change. \n",

This came after months of dogged reporting on various financial matters relating to the couple by the Baltimore Brew. The investigation has in many ways highlighted the amount of work all city leaders and institutions must do to truly free Baltimore of the stigma of corruption. Some of the questions that should have been immediately answered after the investigation was made public: Should Nick Mosby, who sits on the Board of Estimates, have influence over the way the city spends its money when he himself is under increased scrutiny for his own financial matters? Should Marilyn Mosby continue to work with federal agents as part of her job heading up the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office if she is also under federal investigation? Would either Nick or Marilyn be taking a step back while the investigation played out? The two have not stepped down or stepped back, and have, through their lawyer, defended their innocence. In the time that authorities need to complete their investigation, they and other city leaders need to be as transparent as possible. So far, this has not happened.  Mayor Brandon Scott had just spoken about the need for transparency in his State of the City address the day before the news broke.  “Given the public skepticism and disappointment towards City Hall, it was critical that I work to regain your faith and prove that local government can operate in your best interests,” he said. \n",

Two days after President Rodrigo Duterte told police and soldiers to “kill” and “finish off” communist rebels in encounters, the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) mounted a deadly crackdown in Calabarzon on Sunday, March 7. As of 1 pm on Sunday, police and soldiers reported killing 9 and arresting 6 individuals believed to be with activist groups in Laguna, Rizal, and Batangas, provinces surrounding capital region Metro Manila. Police said in their report that they were serving search warrants, but progressive groups described them as executions. Among those killed was Emmanuel “Manny” Asuncion, secretary general of BAYAN in Cavite, who is a known mass organizer in the Southern Tagalog.

Two days after President Rodrigo Duterte told police and soldiers to “kill” and “finish off” communist rebels in encounters, the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) mounted a deadly crackdown in Calabarzon on Sunday, March 7. As of 1 pm on Sunday, police and soldiers reported killing 9 and arresting 6 individuals believed to be with activist groups in Laguna, Rizal, and Batangas, provinces surrounding capital region Metro Manila. Police said in their report that they were serving search warrants, but progressive groups described them as executions. Among those killed was Emmanuel “Manny” Asuncion, secretary general of BAYAN in Cavite, who is a known mass organizer in the Southern Tagalog.

If the union vote is successful, workers at the Bessemer facility will become the first unionized Amazon workforce in the United States.

      " Date: 2021-03-01 00:00:00 \n",
      " Content: Eddie Conway: In recent years, the issue of mass incarceration had reached the United States popular conscience, from Black artists speaking out at the Academy Awards … John Legend [Video Clip]: There are more Black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. Eddie Conway: To Netflix documentaries, such as 13th. Michelle Alexander [Video Clip]: After the Civil War, African-Americans were arrested en masse. It was our nation’s first prison bill. Eddie Conway: And even in recent presidential debates. Tulsi Gabbard [Video Clip]: I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting Black and Brown people all across this country today. Eddie Conway: Yet the issue has not been sufficiently addressed in any manner, as 2.3 million people still remain incarcerated in the United States of America. A recent study by the Justice Policy Institute shows that Maryland incarcerates more Black male adults than any other state in the United States. Shasta Deen: I guess at this point, we know that things are out of control. Eddie Conway: The issue becomes more stark when we realize that most of the people incarcerated in Maryland comes from Baltimore City. I spoke about this at a life sentencing conference in 2017. Eddie Conway [Video Clip]: In the urban communities, the citizens are locked up. In the rural communities, the citizens are locking those urban citizens up. So you create a situation where you have jobs for one community, incarceration, or I call it imprisonment, for another community. Eddie Conway: Yet Maryland officials have a different view of what’s going on. In a past debate between Governor Hogan and Ben Jealous, who was running for government, Hogan stated that Maryland’s incarceration rate and prison conditions had been reformed, and was improving. Governor Larry Hogan [Video Clip]: We’ve reduced our prison population more than the other 49 states. We’re number one in America, in reducing the prison population. Eddie Conway: In lieu of the progressive image that Maryland Governor Hogan was presenting, former Maryland prison guard, and executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, Marc Schindler, thought it was important to release this report. Marc Schindler: There’s been some progress in Maryland, a little bit. There’s been declines in the prison population in recent years, and I think we should all applaud that, but they haven’t gone anywhere near far enough. Marc Schindler: We thought it was time to do a couple things. One, to remind folks of the significant issues within Maryland’s justice system, or, as some I think would fairly call it, the injustice system in Maryland, including the deep and stark racial disparities that we’re seeing overall. Eddie Conway: The report reveals that Maryland is number one in locking up Black males from 18 to 24, and keeping them locked up, and breaking up families for decades. Marc Schindler: A significant majority of the people who are serving long sentences in Maryland’s prisons went in before they were aged 25 years. Eddie Conway: Yes, yes. Marc Schindler: They went in when they were young adults. We didn’t do good things or productive things when they were younger, and now they’re still sitting in Maryland’s prison prisons, as older individuals. Marc Schindler: It’s the same population at two different points in time. We wanted to lift up that discussion, and really draw attention, again, to the really alarming racial disparities in Maryland’s justice system, and really have people, hopefully, start to do something about it. Eddie Conway: Schindler talks about how Black communities are disproportionately affected by social abandonment by the state, in Maryland, and nationwide. I sat down with Schindler to talk about the report on black mass incarceration in Maryland, before the pandemic hit in 2020. Marc Schindler: It’s a larger issue within our society, including what we see in Maryland, right? So if you looked at Maryland’s child welfare system, you would see disparate treatment of kids of color. If you looked at Maryland’s schools, right, you would see a higher percentage of Black and Latino kids being suspended and expelled from school. If you looked at housing, right, if you looked at employment. Eddie Conway: When I first heard about this report, Louisiana came to mind, it popped in my head, and I’m seeing Angola is the largest prison system in the United States. Marc Schindler: Yeah. Eddie Conway: I thought of Texas, I thought of Mississippi. What’s the calculus you used to determine that Maryland is the most corporate of incarceration states? Marc Schindler: Maryland leads the nation in a way that we shouldn’t be proud of at all. So, more than twice the national average, in terms of people, the proportion of people in its prison system that are Black, and more than those other states you ticked off, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina. We can’t just recognize it. What are we going to do about it? Eddie Conway: After slavery ended in ’65, whatever, prison systems sprung up all over the South. Marc Schindler: That’s right. Eddie Conway: And obviously, here in Maryland, also. I mean, does the Institute see this as a continuation of slavery? Marc Schindler: Clearly, the original sin in this country, of slavery, hasn’t fully gone away, and we’re still seeing the repercussions. In some ways, most explicitly, we see that in our justice system. Marc Schindler: The other thing, I think, we have to remind ourself, when we think about Maryland, and we talk about those other Southern states is, Maryland is a Southern state. Eddie Conway: Yes, yes, that is- Marc Schindler: But I think, sometimes, we forget that we are below the Mason-Dixon line, right? Eddie Conway: Yeah, the Mason-Dixon, yes. Yeah. Marc Schindler: Maryland likes to hold itself out as a progressive state, but in many ways, it’s not. Eddie Conway: In order to redress the issue of mass incarceration in Maryland, a holistic approach need to be taken, according to Schindler, and more resources need to be directed to the Black community, and support structures. Marc Schindler: There’s a range of policies that we should be looking at, including things outside the justice system. We have to fund our education appropriately, and not have two different systems, one, for example, in Montgomery County, and another one in Baltimore City. Eddie Conway: Yeah. Marc Schindler: Right? Eddie Conway: Yeah. Marc Schindler: So we need to start leveling the playing field, in that respect. That also goes for housing, that goes for employment, right? There’s a range of issues, that, as we talked about, all impact how people do, and ultimately, whether they end up coming into contact with the justice system. So we have to start looking at policies outside the justice system. Eddie Conway: Shasta Deen, formerly incarcerated in the Maryland correctional system, points out that the longer you keep a person incarcerated, the more it costs the state, and, of course, the taxpayers. Shasta Deen: Because when you talk about age, you talk about medical issues and medical concerns. So we already know what it kind of costs, and I don’t know if the numbers have changed, but it’s thousands of dollars a year, just to house an individual. Then, when you add to the fact that they got medical issues, then it just increases, and it becomes a burden on taxpayers. Eddie Conway: In fact, Maryland spends over $288 million annually on corrections in Baltimore alone. Instead of investing so much money in locking up people, Maryland should do a mass release of elderly prisoners, because elderly prisoners costs more to incarcerate. Eddie Conway: In 2014, there was a mass release of elderly prisoners under the Unger case, where almost 200 prisoners were released, and there was one or two incidents in the entire release. Marc Schindler: One thing we know, when we talk about, for instance, the geriatric population of incarcerated elderly folks who are in Maryland’s prisons? We’ve got over a thousand people in Maryland’s prisons sitting today, who are over the over 60 years of age, who pose very little threat to public safety. The disproportionate number of those folks are Black, right? Eddie Conway: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes. Marc Schindler: The disproportionate number of them are Black men who went to prison under the age of 25. That’s the other data point where Maryland unfortunately leads the country. 40% higher than other places, right? Eddie Conway: Wow. Marc Schindler: So we really have to have a conversation about what are we doing with those young Black men now? And what are we doing with the older Black men who are sitting in prison today, who went there decades ago, who no longer pose a risk to society? Why aren’t we, like with the Ungers, looking at how they can be safely returned to the community? Shasta Deen: We’ve already seen how individuals who’ve come home, they have impacted, and they have made some differences in young people’s lives. Clearly, that would be another benefit, if more individuals, who have reached a certain age, if you talk about that aging population, could come. Then they could bring value to the communities that they live in, to the neighborhoods, and even to the city. I mean, we can go even broader than that, but again, we have examples. Eddie Conway: During the COVID-19 outbreak, Governor Hogan stated that prisons were the safest place to be. National statistics show that prisons are a hotbed for spreading the pandemic, and the rate of deaths in the prison system is three times higher than that of the rate of the US population. Eddie Conway: Yet Governor Hogan put in an order, simultaneously, as he was saying, overcrowded prisons were safe, that would ban people from out in the larger community from gathering in groups any larger than 10. Because of public pressure, Governor Hogan agreed to release at least a thousand prisoners during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eddie Conway: Yet he only released those that had misdemeanor charges, and were eligible to be released within three or four months, anyway. Thousands of elderly prisoners still remain locked up in the Maryland prison system, as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread. Until recently, the horrifyingly unjust reality of America’s mass incarceration system has not been a central concern in popular political discourse. In the past few years, however, more people have learned about the brutality and inhumanity of mass incarceration as artists, activists, documentarians, and elected officials have called attention to the broken U.S. criminal justice system—and its disproportionate harm to Black and Brown people. But is this increased awareness of the problem translating to increased efforts to address it? While officials like Maryland’s Gov. Larry Hogan say they’re reducing incarceration rates and improving prison conditions, the data tells a different story. For instance, the Justice Policy Institute’s report “Rethinking Approaches to Over Incarceration of Black Young Adults in Maryland” shows that Maryland incarcerates Black people at more than twice the national rate and leads the country in incarcerating young Black men. In this episode of “Rattling the Bars,” Eddie Conway speaks with Justice Policy Institute’s Marc Schindler and returning citizen Shasta Deen about how the repercussions of slavery are still felt in Maryland’s justice system.

      " Content: Eddie Conway: In recent years, the issue of mass incarceration had reached the United States popular conscience, from Black artists speaking out at the Academy Awards … John Legend [Video Clip]: There are more Black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. Eddie Conway: To Netflix documentaries, such as 13th. Michelle Alexander [Video Clip]: After the Civil War, African-Americans were arrested en masse. It was our nation’s first prison bill. Eddie Conway: And even in recent presidential debates. Tulsi Gabbard [Video Clip]: I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting Black and Brown people all across this country today. Eddie Conway: Yet the issue has not been sufficiently addressed in any manner, as 2.3 million people still remain incarcerated in the United States of America. A recent study by the Justice Policy Institute shows that Maryland incarcerates more Black male adults than any other state in the United States. Shasta Deen: I guess at this point, we know that things are out of control. Eddie Conway: The issue becomes more stark when we realize that most of the people incarcerated in Maryland comes from Baltimore City. I spoke about this at a life sentencing conference in 2017. Eddie Conway [Video Clip]: In the urban communities, the citizens are locked up. In the rural communities, the citizens are locking those urban citizens up. So you create a situation where you have jobs for one community, incarceration, or I call it imprisonment, for another community. Eddie Conway: Yet Maryland officials have a different view of what’s going on. In a past debate between Governor Hogan and Ben Jealous, who was running for government, Hogan stated that Maryland’s incarceration rate and prison conditions had been reformed, and was improving. Governor Larry Hogan [Video Clip]: We’ve reduced our prison population more than the other 49 states. We’re number one in America, in reducing the prison population. Eddie Conway: In lieu of the progressive image that Maryland Governor Hogan was presenting, former Maryland prison guard, and executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, Marc Schindler, thought it was important to release this report. Marc Schindler: There’s been some progress in Maryland, a little bit. There’s been declines in the prison population in recent years, and I think we should all applaud that, but they haven’t gone anywhere near far enough. Marc Schindler: We thought it was time to do a couple things. One, to remind folks of the significant issues within Maryland’s justice system, or, as some I think would fairly call it, the injustice system in Maryland, including the deep and stark racial disparities that we’re seeing overall. Eddie Conway: The report reveals that Maryland is number one in locking up Black males from 18 to 24, and keeping them locked up, and breaking up families for decades. Marc Schindler: A significant majority of the people who are serving long sentences in Maryland’s prisons went in before they were aged 25 years. Eddie Conway: Yes, yes. Marc Schindler: They went in when they were young adults. We didn’t do good things or productive things when they were younger, and now they’re still sitting in Maryland’s prison prisons, as older individuals. Marc Schindler: It’s the same population at two different points in time. We wanted to lift up that discussion, and really draw attention, again, to the really alarming racial disparities in Maryland’s justice system, and really have people, hopefully, start to do something about it. Eddie Conway: Schindler talks about how Black communities are disproportionately affected by social abandonment by the state, in Maryland, and nationwide. I sat down with Schindler to talk about the report on black mass incarceration in Maryland, before the pandemic hit in 2020. Marc Schindler: It’s a larger issue within our society, including what we see in Maryland, right? So if you looked at Maryland’s child welfare system, you would see disparate treatment of kids of color. If you looked at Maryland’s schools, right, you would see a higher percentage of Black and Latino kids being suspended and expelled from school. If you looked at housing, right, if you looked at employment. Eddie Conway: When I first heard about this report, Louisiana came to mind, it popped in my head, and I’m seeing Angola is the largest prison system in the United States. Marc Schindler: Yeah. Eddie Conway: I thought of Texas, I thought of Mississippi. What’s the calculus you used to determine that Maryland is the most corporate of incarceration states? Marc Schindler: Maryland leads the nation in a way that we shouldn’t be proud of at all. So, more than twice the national average, in terms of people, the proportion of people in its prison system that are Black, and more than those other states you ticked off, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina. We can’t just recognize it. What are we going to do about it? Eddie Conway: After slavery ended in ’65, whatever, prison systems sprung up all over the South. Marc Schindler: That’s right. Eddie Conway: And obviously, here in Maryland, also. I mean, does the Institute see this as a continuation of slavery? Marc Schindler: Clearly, the original sin in this country, of slavery, hasn’t fully gone away, and we’re still seeing the repercussions. In some ways, most explicitly, we see that in our justice system. Marc Schindler: The other thing, I think, we have to remind ourself, when we think about Maryland, and we talk about those other Southern states is, Maryland is a Southern state. Eddie Conway: Yes, yes, that is- Marc Schindler: But I think, sometimes, we forget that we are below the Mason-Dixon line, right? Eddie Conway: Yeah, the Mason-Dixon, yes. Yeah. Marc Schindler: Maryland likes to hold itself out as a progressive state, but in many ways, it’s not. Eddie Conway: In order to redress the issue of mass incarceration in Maryland, a holistic approach need to be taken, according to Schindler, and more resources need to be directed to the Black community, and support structures. Marc Schindler: There’s a range of policies that we should be looking at, including things outside the justice system. We have to fund our education appropriately, and not have two different systems, one, for example, in Montgomery County, and another one in Baltimore City. Eddie Conway: Yeah. Marc Schindler: Right? Eddie Conway: Yeah. Marc Schindler: So we need to start leveling the playing field, in that respect. That also goes for housing, that goes for employment, right? There’s a range of issues, that, as we talked about, all impact how people do, and ultimately, whether they end up coming into contact with the justice system. So we have to start looking at policies outside the justice system. Eddie Conway: Shasta Deen, formerly incarcerated in the Maryland correctional system, points out that the longer you keep a person incarcerated, the more it costs the state, and, of course, the taxpayers. Shasta Deen: Because when you talk about age, you talk about medical issues and medical concerns. So we already know what it kind of costs, and I don’t know if the numbers have changed, but it’s thousands of dollars a year, just to house an individual. Then, when you add to the fact that they got medical issues, then it just increases, and it becomes a burden on taxpayers. Eddie Conway: In fact, Maryland spends over $288 million annually on corrections in Baltimore alone. Instead of investing so much money in locking up people, Maryland should do a mass release of elderly prisoners, because elderly prisoners costs more to incarcerate. Eddie Conway: In 2014, there was a mass release of elderly prisoners under the Unger case, where almost 200 prisoners were released, and there was one or two incidents in the entire release. Marc Schindler: One thing we know, when we talk about, for instance, the geriatric population of incarcerated elderly folks who are in Maryland’s prisons? We’ve got over a thousand people in Maryland’s prisons sitting today, who are over the over 60 years of age, who pose very little threat to public safety. The disproportionate number of those folks are Black, right? Eddie Conway: Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes. Marc Schindler: The disproportionate number of them are Black men who went to prison under the age of 25. That’s the other data point where Maryland unfortunately leads the country. 40% higher than other places, right? Eddie Conway: Wow. Marc Schindler: So we really have to have a conversation about what are we doing with those young Black men now? And what are we doing with the older Black men who are sitting in prison today, who went there decades ago, who no longer pose a risk to society? Why aren’t we, like with the Ungers, looking at how they can be safely returned to the community? Shasta Deen: We’ve already seen how individuals who’ve come home, they have impacted, and they have made some differences in young people’s lives. Clearly, that would be another benefit, if more individuals, who have reached a certain age, if you talk about that aging population, could come. Then they could bring value to the communities that they live in, to the neighborhoods, and even to the city. I mean, we can go even broader than that, but again, we have examples.

      " Content: One reason why The Real News Network calls Baltimore home is because we know that the struggles the people in this majority-minority city face (unequitable access to resources like education, clean air, and transportation, for example) are the struggles people face all over the globe. This is the latest installment of our weekly news roundup from the Baltimore trenches, which we hope will help keep our friends and neighbors abreast of what’s going on in our city, but we also hope these stories will resonate with people united in the struggle everywhere. On Sunday, Feb. 20, outside of the Sparrows Point Amazon facility in Baltimore County, several dozen people braved freezing temperatures to hold a car caravan and demonstration in solidarity with unionizing Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama. The historic union drive of mostly Black Amazon workers in Alabama is making waves across the country, including in Baltimore, where dozens rallied in solidarity last weekend. The highest-profile organizing drive in the South in recent memory has gained steam amid a COVID-19 pandemic that has boosted Amazon’s profits and market share, along with the wealth of its founder Jeff Bezos (who has gained at least $90 billion and is reportedly seeking to buy the Washington Football Team). Hundreds of workers across the country have contracted COVID-19, and many have been fired forspeaking out about unsafe working conditions.  \n",

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops, but try to dig deeper and expose the underlying system that makes bad policing possible. Today, we have an important update that speaks exactly to our purpose, another questionable arrest by police solely for the act of filming them. A set of charges with troubling ties to questionable case that we have already reported about on this show and we will examine how police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate them, so they can pay their own salaries. But before I get started, I need to ask for your support. Remember, we can’t do this type of work without you, so please, if you can, hit the donate link below and I want you to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com or reach out to me and message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter and Facebook. Of course, please like, share and comment on our videos. Okay. We’ve got that out of the way. Now, as many of you recall, just a few weeks ago, we reported on the arrest and beating of Nick Pettit by Columbus, Ohio police. Pettit was filming police on his own porch when he caught them striking a juvenile. Pettit spoke up and police attacked. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP] Nick Pettit: Hey, you weren’t supposed to smack him in the face. What the fuck is wrong with you? Speaker 1: Go back to your house. Nick Pettit: Hell no, man. I’m on my property. I ain’t got to listen to you. Speaker 1: [crosstalk 00:01:49] Get in the house. Go in the house. Speaker 2: Go inside. Speaker 1: Get in the house. Go on inside. Nick Pettit: Hey, look, I got you all on camera right now. I’m on my private property. Speaker 2: [crosstalk 00:02:01] You’re under arrest. Nick Pettit: For what? Speaker 1: Come on. Nick Pettit: I didn’t even do nothing except record this whole situation. What are you doing? [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Taya Graham: Last month, Pettit and the ACLU filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, alleging the arrest was illegal and violated his constitutional rights. But one intriguing aspect of the case was the law used to charge Pettit for his alleged transgression. It’s an obscure statute called Misconduct During an Emergency, a nebulous infraction that even after some extensive research seemed designed to allow police flexibility to arrest people for behavior they find, for lack of a better word, annoying. But just this week, another viewer in Ohio contacted us with startling information. Anthony Holbrook was also arrested for filming cops on his own property, and he too was charged with the vaguely worded Misconduct During an Emergency. For more on this arrest and what the video shows I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, give me some overview on this video and his arrest. What does it show and what are we looking at? Stephen Janis: What’s interesting about this video is that you see initially police handle a situation that could have been potentially dangerous quite well. They are able to stop a man who has a fake gun and is threatening people. So they get that done pretty effectively. What’s weird at the end of the video, after this is all over, they start to harass this man and ask him for information which he doesn’t want to provide and then turn it into arrest. [VIDEO CLIP] Speaker: You don’t have to give us any statements but you have to identify yourself. Anthony Holbrook: I wish to remain silent at this time. Speaker: Is that your final answer? Anthony Holbrook: Yeah. Speaker: [crosstalk 00:03:42], okay. Put your hands behind your back. Anthony Holbrook: Wow. [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Stephen Janis: So really the video is kind of troubling because at that point, everything was over and there was no reason really to engage this man. Taya Graham: Now, you’ve looked into this law. What does it actually say? Stephen Janis: Well, what it says is that you can’t interfere with either a police officer or an EMT or a firefighter on the scene of an accident, but what’s interesting about it and it doesn’t really define interference, but it also says that you have to obey a lawful order. So it’s really kind of very vague and then of course it has one exception for the media. So I think this would classify as a media kind of situation because it’s the only place where you don’t really have to abide by the law in that situation, where you can’t be subject to arrest. So really the law contradicts what happened. Taya Graham: So the reason police initially gave for his arrest was that he had refused to show them his ID. Is that legal? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s a really interesting question. There is no federal law that says you have to identify yourself to a police officer. However, in Ohio, if you are witness to a felony, you’re supposed to be give identification. The question would be here, was he really a witness to a felony? Was he the only witness or was this more about the fact that he was filming police? And I think that’s a crucial question as to his arrest, because to me it seems like they’re more interested in the fact that he was filming police, given that the fact that this occurred in front of multiple people and it really wasn’t a question of what had happened. So I think the fact that he was filming gave him some protection there. I think it’s very troubling that police would use this law once again to get someone who was filming police and who were just really exercising their First Amendment rights. Taya Graham: And now to get more details on the video and the consequences of yet another questionable arrest I’m joined by Anthony Holbrook. Anthony, thank you so much for joining me. Anthony Holbrook: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So first I want to ask you to describe the events preceding your arrest. What were the cops doing in your neighborhood? Anthony Holbrook: They were dealing with a guy who had apparently been drunk and arguing with an ex-girlfriend and his step-son. I made sure I stayed away in my own driveway, tried to not communicate with the police. After it was all done they started asking everybody for their IDs and of course they got to me and I politely just declined so one guy, cop, sergeant, I’m not sure, he snapped his fingers and the two cops arrested me and charged me with obstruction, but I didn’t understand it because they had first told me I’m not in any trouble. They don’t need a statement. All they needed was my name, but before they even got the handcuffs on, they smacked my phone out of my hand and shut it off. I heard my plates and my name, my date of birth come over their radio. So they was already running tags before I answered any questions. Taya Graham: So after the police had arrested the man, they asked you for ID and you refused. Can you talk about why? Anthony Holbrook: Well, there were several things running through my head of why I did want [inaudible 00:07:01] the police. There’s been some scary stories that I’ve heard that police get your information, that is sold sometimes to third parties. But my main reason is, and I know this is weird, but the very first time I reported the police, they threatened me, made me give them my name and a couple months later I went to PeopleFinders and now I noticed on PeopleFinders that I am supposedly a suspect of being organized with a terrorist group. So that freaked me out when I seen that. So that’s why I didn’t want to give my name. I have heard of people reporting police and when they give their name, sometimes these cops will put them in a database or something like that and they’ll end up on a terrorist watch-list simply for reporting police. So I was scared. I didn’t want to give my name because I didn’t have anything to do with it. Taya Graham: I think it’s worth noting you were talking to Stephen before this interview about a pivotal moment prior to these arrests, when you became distrustful of police. Can you tell us about what happened? Anthony Holbrook: Back in 2015 I think, I was in college. After school I would drop my aunt and uncle off at their house and for no apparent reason I was pulled over by the Brady Lake police and they pulled us all out of the car. Wouldn’t tell me why and then searched my whole car without asking me for my permission and said I was free to go. I asked them why and they said because I was in a high-crime area. So that irritated. So that’s when I began to look into my constitutional rights because I was mad that they just abused their power and that’s when I started looking into my rights and started reporting police when I could. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what happened after you were arrested? How long were you in jail and what did prosecutors do with the case? Anthony Holbrook: Once they put me in the back of the police car, I started having anxiety. I started coughing. They must have assumed that I was sick and COVID had just came really big. So they put me in a cell and treated me like I had a bad disease. They refused to give me any of my medications. The next morning, this was around 9:00 at night, maybe 9:30, the next morning, around 8:30, 9:00 in the morning. I see the judge, I got a PR bond, but they wouldn’t let me out till around 4:00 that evening and then I noticed on my paperwork that the only reason they’re claiming that I didn’t see the judge until 3:00 or 3:20 in the evening and that’s why it took so long to release. Within six months, it was dismissed. I had to go all the way to trial. I had a public defender who I asked to get the body cam footage or the dash cam footage, try to find out why I was not only charged with obstruction, but misconduct at an emergency and he said there was no video and there was no dash cam and that the case was dismissed at the trial date. Taya Graham: How has this affected you? What have been the consequences for you? Whether emotional or financial? Anthony Holbrook: Recently, I’m having trouble getting a place to live, an apartment for my daughter and I because of these charges. And I’ve noticed that when I see cops get behind me while I’m driving, I get real bad anxiety and it wasn’t so bad until they arrested me for in my opinion, no reason that night. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what would you need to make you whole, or what would you want see happen to restore your trust in law enforcement? Anthony Holbrook: I don’t know if an apology would really do it because in the past, a couple of years ago, the cops threatened me just for recording them, threatened to blow me up. That if I was in Afghanistan and I was reporting them, they would blow me up like they did someone else. So it’s a little scary. I’ll put it this way. After the incident, it seemed like every time I was outside throwing the football back and forth with my daughter or brother-in-law, the sheriffs were always driving by at least once a day. I don’t know if it was me being paranoid. I don’t know, but I would just like to see a change. Taya Graham: Now, as we always try to do on the show, I want to connect the dots in Anthony’s story to a larger problem with law enforcement today. That is to try to provide some context on why the seemingly needless arrest of one man is critical to understanding the broader problems with American policing that we are all faced with today. And to do so, I want to take a look at a recent New York Times op-ed that examines how the monetization of law enforcement has turned America into a vast land of debtor’s prisons. Now, before I explain the premise of the article, just a little historical side note, imprisoning someone for an unpaid debt was actually something our country used to frown upon. In fact, it was considered to be such a destructive idea. Then in 1867, the Anti-Peonage Act was passed by Congress to prevent involuntary servitude for debt and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was used by federal, district and supreme court justices to protect Americans from being imprisoned for court-related fines and fees. But as the article points out, that initial historical hesitancy has been discarded and the practice has become more commonplace, even ubiquitous. In fact, according to the article, The New Debt Prisons by Gene Sperling, the state of Texas imprisons over 500,000 people for unpaid debts. That’s just in the state of Texas alone. But these aren’t just people who failed to pay a credit card bill, or just decide to skip out on their monthly car note. No, these scofflaws end up behind bars because, wait for it, they have not paid court fines, probation fees, and even bills for being in jail in the first place. In other words, as states across the country, continue to impose fines and fees to people entangled in our criminal justice system, people who can’t pay sometimes find themselves locked away again. The problem has become so acute in so many communities that Sperling says our country has become quote, “A punitive debt trap for millions of low income Americans, essentially a debtor’s prison writ large”. But of course it is why cities and states have been raising these fees that is even more troubling. According to the article, the main reason fees have become so prohibitive is because they’re used to fund the same cops and courts that impose them. That’s right. As I said before, police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate so they can pay their own salary. So how could that go wrong? I mean, think about it. A system predicated on financializing criminal justice is basically a solution in search of a problem. A cop who knows his or her generous salary and pricey benefits are based on how many people end up in handcuffs is going to find as many ways to slap them on as many wrists as possible. A prosecutor or judge who knows court fees and criminal fines will pay for a cushy pension or lavish health benefits is surely going to search for as many ways to impose them as they can. The point is how can we trust a criminal justice system predicated upon profit? How can we literally trust a system that is using force and the threat of imprisonment to extract cash from the people it’s supposed to protect? I’m not sure what you call it, but it sounds like racketeering to me with a bit of communal extortion on the side. The worst part is that this power over our collective purse has no natural checks or balances. As we’ve seen again and again on this show, once a bad arrest is made, there are no repercussions for the officer or the department that allowed it. There are no charges or investigations into bad police behavior. Instead, even bad arrests end up a win for police with victims forced to pay court costs, lawyer fees and fines that accumulate usury interest if they aren’t paid off immediately. The point is we can’t have a criminal justice system that operates on the imperative of profit. Funding policing by the monetization of criminality takes the worst aspects of capitalism and the fascist impulses of a society obsessed with punishment and creates an anti-democratic stew so toxic, it could kill even the healthiest democracy. That’s why stories like the arrest of Anthony Holbrook must be told, and that’s why we won’t stop telling them. I would like to thank my guest Anthony Holbrook for joining me today. Anthony, thank you so much for your time. Anthony Holbrook: I was nervous, thank you. Taya Graham: And of course I would like to thank intrepid reporter, Stephen Janis for his editing, writing and reporting on this piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Okay, Taya.

A set of charges with troubling ties to questionable case that we have already reported about on this show and we will examine how police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate them, so they can pay their own salaries. But before I get started, I need to ask for your support. Remember, we can’t do this type of work without you, so please, if you can, hit the donate link below and I want you to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com or reach out to me and message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter and Facebook. Of course, please like, share and comment on our videos. Okay. We’ve got that out of the way. Now, as many of you recall, just a few weeks ago, we reported on the arrest and beating of Nick Pettit by Columbus, Ohio police. Pettit was filming police on his own porch when he caught them striking a juvenile. Pettit spoke up and police attacked. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP] Nick Pettit: Hey, you weren’t supposed to smack him in the face. What the fuck is wrong with you? Speaker 1: Go back to your house. Nick Pettit: Hell no, man. I’m on my property. I ain’t got to listen to you. Speaker 1: [crosstalk 00:01:49] Get in the house. Go in the house. Speaker 2: Go inside. Speaker 1: Get in the house. Go on inside. Nick Pettit: Hey, look, I got you all on camera right now. I’m on my private property. Speaker 2: [crosstalk 00:02:01] You’re under arrest. Nick Pettit: For what? Speaker 1: Come on. Nick Pettit: I didn’t even do nothing except record this whole situation. What are you doing? [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Taya Graham: Last month, Pettit and the ACLU filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, alleging the arrest was illegal and violated his constitutional rights. But one intriguing aspect of the case was the law used to charge Pettit for his alleged transgression. It’s an obscure statute called Misconduct During an Emergency, a nebulous infraction that even after some extensive research seemed designed to allow police flexibility to arrest people for behavior they find, for lack of a better word, annoying. But just this week, another viewer in Ohio contacted us with startling information. Anthony Holbrook was also arrested for filming cops on his own property, and he too was charged with the vaguely worded Misconduct During an Emergency. For more on this arrest and what the video shows I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, give me some overview on this video and his arrest. What does it show and what are we looking at? Stephen Janis: What’s interesting about this video is that you see initially police handle a situation that could have been potentially dangerous quite well. They are able to stop a man who has a fake gun and is threatening people. So they get that done pretty effectively. What’s weird at the end of the video, after this is all over, they start to harass this man and ask him for information which he doesn’t want to provide and then turn it into arrest. [VIDEO CLIP] Speaker: You don’t have to give us any statements but you have to identify yourself. Anthony Holbrook: I wish to remain silent at this time. Speaker: Is that your final answer? Anthony Holbrook: Yeah. Speaker: [crosstalk 00:03:42], okay. Put your hands behind your back. Anthony Holbrook: Wow. [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Stephen Janis: So really the video is kind of troubling because at that point, everything was over and there was no reason really to engage this man. Taya Graham: Now, you’ve looked into this law. What does it actually say? Stephen Janis: Well, what it says is that you can’t interfere with either a police officer or an EMT or a firefighter on the scene of an accident, but what’s interesting about it and it doesn’t really define interference, but it also says that you have to obey a lawful order. So it’s really kind of very vague and then of course it has one exception for the media. So I think this would classify as a media kind of situation because it’s the only place where you don’t really have to abide by the law in that situation, where you can’t be subject to arrest. So really the law contradicts what happened. Taya Graham: So the reason police initially gave for his arrest was that he had refused to show them his ID. Is that legal? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s a really interesting question. There is no federal law that says you have to identify yourself to a police officer. However, in Ohio, if you are witness to a felony, you’re supposed to be give identification. The question would be here, was he really a witness to a felony? Was he the only witness or was this more about the fact that he was filming police? And I think that’s a crucial question as to his arrest, because to me it seems like they’re more interested in the fact that he was filming police, given that the fact that this occurred in front of multiple people and it really wasn’t a question of what had happened. So I think the fact that he was filming gave him some protection there. I think it’s very troubling that police would use this law once again to get someone who was filming police and who were just really exercising their First Amendment rights. Taya Graham: And now to get more details on the video and the consequences of yet another questionable arrest I’m joined by Anthony Holbrook. Anthony, thank you so much for joining me. Anthony Holbrook: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So first I want to ask you to describe the events preceding your arrest. What were the cops doing in your neighborhood? Anthony Holbrook: They were dealing with a guy who had apparently been drunk and arguing with an ex-girlfriend and his step-son. I made sure I stayed away in my own driveway, tried to not communicate with the police. After it was all done they started asking everybody for their IDs and of course they got to me and I politely just declined so one guy, cop, sergeant, I’m not sure, he snapped his fingers and the two cops arrested me and charged me with obstruction, but I didn’t understand it because they had first told me I’m not in any trouble. They don’t need a statement. All they needed was my name, but before they even got the handcuffs on, they smacked my phone out of my hand and shut it off. I heard my plates and my name, my date of birth come over their radio. So they was already running tags before I answered any questions. Taya Graham: So after the police had arrested the man, they asked you for ID and you refused. Can you talk about why? Anthony Holbrook: Well, there were several things running through my head of why I did want [inaudible 00:07:01] the police. There’s been some scary stories that I’ve heard that police get your information, that is sold sometimes to third parties. But my main reason is, and I know this is weird, but the very first time I reported the police, they threatened me, made me give them my name and a couple months later I went to PeopleFinders and now I noticed on PeopleFinders that I am supposedly a suspect of being organized with a terrorist group. So that freaked me out when I seen that. So that’s why I didn’t want to give my name. I have heard of people reporting police and when they give their name, sometimes these cops will put them in a database or something like that and they’ll end up on a terrorist watch-list simply for reporting police. So I was scared. I didn’t want to give my name because I didn’t have anything to do with it. Taya Graham: I think it’s worth noting you were talking to Stephen before this interview about a pivotal moment prior to these arrests, when you became distrustful of police. Can you tell us about what happened? Anthony Holbrook: Back in 2015 I think, I was in college. After school I would drop my aunt and uncle off at their house and for no apparent reason I was pulled over by the Brady Lake police and they pulled us all out of the car. Wouldn’t tell me why and then searched my whole car without asking me for my permission and said I was free to go. I asked them why and they said because I was in a high-crime area. So that irritated. So that’s when I began to look into my constitutional rights because I was mad that they just abused their power and that’s when I started looking into my rights and started reporting police when I could. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what happened after you were arrested? How long were you in jail and what did prosecutors do with the case? Anthony Holbrook: Once they put me in the back of the police car, I started having anxiety. I started coughing. They must have assumed that I was sick and COVID had just came really big. So they put me in a cell and treated me like I had a bad disease. They refused to give me any of my medications. The next morning, this was around 9:00 at night, maybe 9:30, the next morning, around 8:30, 9:00 in the morning. I see the judge, I got a PR bond, but they wouldn’t let me out till around 4:00 that evening and then I noticed on my paperwork that the only reason they’re claiming that I didn’t see the judge until 3:00 or 3:20 in the evening and that’s why it took so long to release. Within six months, it was dismissed. I had to go all the way to trial. I had a public defender who I asked to get the body cam footage or the dash cam footage, try to find out why I was not only charged with obstruction, but misconduct at an emergency and he said there was no video and there was no dash cam and that the case was dismissed at the trial date. Taya Graham: How has this affected you? What have been the consequences for you? Whether emotional or financial? Anthony Holbrook: Recently, I’m having trouble getting a place to live, an apartment for my daughter and I because of these charges. And I’ve noticed that when I see cops get behind me while I’m driving, I get real bad anxiety and it wasn’t so bad until they arrested me for in my opinion, no reason that night. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what would you need to make you whole, or what would you want see happen to restore your trust in law enforcement? Anthony Holbrook: I don’t know if an apology would really do it because in the past, a couple of years ago, the cops threatened me just for recording them, threatened to blow me up. That if I was in Afghanistan and I was reporting them, they would blow me up like they did someone else. So it’s a little scary. I’ll put it this way. After the incident, it seemed like every time I was outside throwing the football back and forth with my daughter or brother-in-law, the sheriffs were always driving by at least once a day. I don’t know if it was me being paranoid. I don’t know, but I would just like to see a change. Taya Graham: Now, as we always try to do on the show, I want to connect the dots in Anthony’s story to a larger problem with law enforcement today. That is to try to provide some context on why the seemingly needless arrest of one man is critical to understanding the broader problems with American policing that we are all faced with today. And to do so, I want to take a look at a recent New York Times op-ed that examines how the monetization of law enforcement has turned America into a vast land of debtor’s prisons. Now, before I explain the premise of the article, just a little historical side note, imprisoning someone for an unpaid debt was actually something our country used to frown upon. In fact, it was considered to be such a destructive idea. Then in 1867, the Anti-Peonage Act was passed by Congress to prevent involuntary servitude for debt and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was used by federal, district and supreme court justices to protect Americans from being imprisoned for court-related fines and fees. But as the article points out, that initial historical hesitancy has been discarded and the practice has become more commonplace, even ubiquitous. In fact, according to the article, The New Debt Prisons by Gene Sperling, the state of Texas imprisons over 500,000 people for unpaid debts. That’s just in the state of Texas alone. But these aren’t just people who failed to pay a credit card bill, or just decide to skip out on their monthly car note. No, these scofflaws end up behind bars because, wait for it, they have not paid court fines, probation fees, and even bills for being in jail in the first place. In other words, as states across the country, continue to impose fines and fees to people entangled in our criminal justice system, people who can’t pay sometimes find themselves locked away again. The problem has become so acute in so many communities that Sperling says our country has become quote, “A punitive debt trap for millions of low income Americans, essentially a debtor’s prison writ large”. But of course it is why cities and states have been raising these fees that is even more troubling. According to the article, the main reason fees have become so prohibitive is because they’re used to fund the same cops and courts that impose them. That’s right. As I said before, police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate so they can pay their own salary. So how could that go wrong? I mean, think about it. A system predicated on financializing criminal justice is basically a solution in search of a problem. A cop who knows his or her generous salary and pricey benefits are based on how many people end up in handcuffs is going to find as many ways to slap them on as many wrists as possible. A prosecutor or judge who knows court fees and criminal fines will pay for a cushy pension or lavish health benefits is surely going to search for as many ways to impose them as they can. The point is how can we trust a criminal justice system predicated upon profit? How can we literally trust a system that is using force and the threat of imprisonment to extract cash from the people it’s supposed to protect? I’m not sure what you call it, but it sounds like racketeering to me with a bit of communal extortion on the side. The worst part is that this power over our collective purse has no natural checks or balances. As we’ve seen again and again on this show, once a bad arrest is made, there are no repercussions for the officer or the department that allowed it. There are no charges or investigations into bad police behavior. Instead, even bad arrests end up a win for police with victims forced to pay court costs, lawyer fees and fines that accumulate usury interest if they aren’t paid off immediately. The point is we can’t have a criminal justice system that operates on the imperative of profit. Funding policing by the monetization of criminality takes the worst aspects of capitalism and the fascist impulses of a society obsessed with punishment and creates an anti-democratic stew so toxic, it could kill even the healthiest democracy. That’s why stories like the arrest of Anthony Holbrook must be told, and that’s why we won’t stop telling them. I would like to thank my guest Anthony Holbrook for joining me today. Anthony, thank you so much for your time. Anthony Holbrook: I was nervous, thank you. Taya Graham: And of course I would like to thank intrepid reporter, Stephen Janis for his editing, writing and reporting on this piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Okay, Taya.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops, but try to dig deeper and expose the underlying system that makes bad policing possible. Today, we have an important update that speaks exactly to our purpose, another questionable arrest by police solely for the act of filming them.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. To do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops, but try to dig deeper and expose the underlying system that makes bad policing possible. Today, we have an important update that speaks exactly to our purpose, another questionable arrest by police solely for the act of filming them. A set of charges with troubling ties to questionable case that we have already reported about on this show and we will examine how police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate them, so they can pay their own salaries. But before I get started, I need to ask for your support. Remember, we can’t do this type of work without you, so please, if you can, hit the donate link below and I want you to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please email it to us privately at par@therealnews.com or reach out to me and message me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter and Facebook. Of course, please like, share and comment on our videos. Okay. We’ve got that out of the way. Now, as many of you recall, just a few weeks ago, we reported on the arrest and beating of Nick Pettit by Columbus, Ohio police. Pettit was filming police on his own porch when he caught them striking a juvenile. Pettit spoke up and police attacked. Let’s watch. [VIDEO CLIP] Nick Pettit: Hey, you weren’t supposed to smack him in the face. What the fuck is wrong with you? Speaker 1: Go back to your house. Nick Pettit: Hell no, man. I’m on my property. I ain’t got to listen to you. Speaker 1: [crosstalk 00:01:49] Get in the house. Go in the house. Speaker 2: Go inside. Speaker 1: Get in the house. Go on inside. Nick Pettit: Hey, look, I got you all on camera right now. I’m on my private property. Speaker 2: [crosstalk 00:02:01] You’re under arrest. Nick Pettit: For what? Speaker 1: Come on. Nick Pettit: I didn’t even do nothing except record this whole situation. What are you doing? [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Taya Graham: Last month, Pettit and the ACLU filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, alleging the arrest was illegal and violated his constitutional rights. But one intriguing aspect of the case was the law used to charge Pettit for his alleged transgression. It’s an obscure statute called Misconduct During an Emergency, a nebulous infraction that even after some extensive research seemed designed to allow police flexibility to arrest people for behavior they find, for lack of a better word, annoying. But just this week, another viewer in Ohio contacted us with startling information. Anthony Holbrook was also arrested for filming cops on his own property, and he too was charged with the vaguely worded Misconduct During an Emergency. For more on this arrest and what the video shows I’m joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis. Stephen, thank you for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: Stephen, give me some overview on this video and his arrest. What does it show and what are we looking at? Stephen Janis: What’s interesting about this video is that you see initially police handle a situation that could have been potentially dangerous quite well. They are able to stop a man who has a fake gun and is threatening people. So they get that done pretty effectively. What’s weird at the end of the video, after this is all over, they start to harass this man and ask him for information which he doesn’t want to provide and then turn it into arrest. [VIDEO CLIP] Speaker: You don’t have to give us any statements but you have to identify yourself. Anthony Holbrook: I wish to remain silent at this time. Speaker: Is that your final answer? Anthony Holbrook: Yeah. Speaker: [crosstalk 00:03:42], okay. Put your hands behind your back. Anthony Holbrook: Wow. [VIDEO CLIP ENDS] Stephen Janis: So really the video is kind of troubling because at that point, everything was over and there was no reason really to engage this man. Taya Graham: Now, you’ve looked into this law. What does it actually say? Stephen Janis: Well, what it says is that you can’t interfere with either a police officer or an EMT or a firefighter on the scene of an accident, but what’s interesting about it and it doesn’t really define interference, but it also says that you have to obey a lawful order. So it’s really kind of very vague and then of course it has one exception for the media. So I think this would classify as a media kind of situation because it’s the only place where you don’t really have to abide by the law in that situation, where you can’t be subject to arrest. So really the law contradicts what happened. Taya Graham: So the reason police initially gave for his arrest was that he had refused to show them his ID. Is that legal? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s a really interesting question. There is no federal law that says you have to identify yourself to a police officer. However, in Ohio, if you are witness to a felony, you’re supposed to be give identification. The question would be here, was he really a witness to a felony? Was he the only witness or was this more about the fact that he was filming police? And I think that’s a crucial question as to his arrest, because to me it seems like they’re more interested in the fact that he was filming police, given that the fact that this occurred in front of multiple people and it really wasn’t a question of what had happened. So I think the fact that he was filming gave him some protection there. I think it’s very troubling that police would use this law once again to get someone who was filming police and who were just really exercising their First Amendment rights. Taya Graham: And now to get more details on the video and the consequences of yet another questionable arrest I’m joined by Anthony Holbrook. Anthony, thank you so much for joining me. Anthony Holbrook: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So first I want to ask you to describe the events preceding your arrest. What were the cops doing in your neighborhood? Anthony Holbrook: They were dealing with a guy who had apparently been drunk and arguing with an ex-girlfriend and his step-son. I made sure I stayed away in my own driveway, tried to not communicate with the police. After it was all done they started asking everybody for their IDs and of course they got to me and I politely just declined so one guy, cop, sergeant, I’m not sure, he snapped his fingers and the two cops arrested me and charged me with obstruction, but I didn’t understand it because they had first told me I’m not in any trouble. They don’t need a statement. All they needed was my name, but before they even got the handcuffs on, they smacked my phone out of my hand and shut it off. I heard my plates and my name, my date of birth come over their radio. So they was already running tags before I answered any questions. Taya Graham: So after the police had arrested the man, they asked you for ID and you refused. Can you talk about why? Anthony Holbrook: Well, there were several things running through my head of why I did want [inaudible 00:07:01] the police. There’s been some scary stories that I’ve heard that police get your information, that is sold sometimes to third parties. But my main reason is, and I know this is weird, but the very first time I reported the police, they threatened me, made me give them my name and a couple months later I went to PeopleFinders and now I noticed on PeopleFinders that I am supposedly a suspect of being organized with a terrorist group. So that freaked me out when I seen that. So that’s why I didn’t want to give my name. I have heard of people reporting police and when they give their name, sometimes these cops will put them in a database or something like that and they’ll end up on a terrorist watch-list simply for reporting police. So I was scared. I didn’t want to give my name because I didn’t have anything to do with it. Taya Graham: I think it’s worth noting you were talking to Stephen before this interview about a pivotal moment prior to these arrests, when you became distrustful of police. Can you tell us about what happened? Anthony Holbrook: Back in 2015 I think, I was in college. After school I would drop my aunt and uncle off at their house and for no apparent reason I was pulled over by the Brady Lake police and they pulled us all out of the car. Wouldn’t tell me why and then searched my whole car without asking me for my permission and said I was free to go. I asked them why and they said because I was in a high-crime area. So that irritated. So that’s when I began to look into my constitutional rights because I was mad that they just abused their power and that’s when I started looking into my rights and started reporting police when I could. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what happened after you were arrested? How long were you in jail and what did prosecutors do with the case? Anthony Holbrook: Once they put me in the back of the police car, I started having anxiety. I started coughing. They must have assumed that I was sick and COVID had just came really big. So they put me in a cell and treated me like I had a bad disease. They refused to give me any of my medications. The next morning, this was around 9:00 at night, maybe 9:30, the next morning, around 8:30, 9:00 in the morning. I see the judge, I got a PR bond, but they wouldn’t let me out till around 4:00 that evening and then I noticed on my paperwork that the only reason they’re claiming that I didn’t see the judge until 3:00 or 3:20 in the evening and that’s why it took so long to release. Within six months, it was dismissed. I had to go all the way to trial. I had a public defender who I asked to get the body cam footage or the dash cam footage, try to find out why I was not only charged with obstruction, but misconduct at an emergency and he said there was no video and there was no dash cam and that the case was dismissed at the trial date. Taya Graham: How has this affected you? What have been the consequences for you? Whether emotional or financial? Anthony Holbrook: Recently, I’m having trouble getting a place to live, an apartment for my daughter and I because of these charges. And I’ve noticed that when I see cops get behind me while I’m driving, I get real bad anxiety and it wasn’t so bad until they arrested me for in my opinion, no reason that night. Taya Graham: So Anthony, what would you need to make you whole, or what would you want see happen to restore your trust in law enforcement? Anthony Holbrook: I don’t know if an apology would really do it because in the past, a couple of years ago, the cops threatened me just for recording them, threatened to blow me up. That if I was in Afghanistan and I was reporting them, they would blow me up like they did someone else. So it’s a little scary. I’ll put it this way. After the incident, it seemed like every time I was outside throwing the football back and forth with my daughter or brother-in-law, the sheriffs were always driving by at least once a day. I don’t know if it was me being paranoid. I don’t know, but I would just like to see a change. Taya Graham: Now, as we always try to do on the show, I want to connect the dots in Anthony’s story to a larger problem with law enforcement today. That is to try to provide some context on why the seemingly needless arrest of one man is critical to understanding the broader problems with American policing that we are all faced with today. And to do so, I want to take a look at a recent New York Times op-ed that examines how the monetization of law enforcement has turned America into a vast land of debtor’s prisons. Now, before I explain the premise of the article, just a little historical side note, imprisoning someone for an unpaid debt was actually something our country used to frown upon. In fact, it was considered to be such a destructive idea. Then in 1867, the Anti-Peonage Act was passed by Congress to prevent involuntary servitude for debt and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was used by federal, district and supreme court justices to protect Americans from being imprisoned for court-related fines and fees. But as the article points out, that initial historical hesitancy has been discarded and the practice has become more commonplace, even ubiquitous. In fact, according to the article, The New Debt Prisons by Gene Sperling, the state of Texas imprisons over 500,000 people for unpaid debts. That’s just in the state of Texas alone. But these aren’t just people who failed to pay a credit card bill, or just decide to skip out on their monthly car note. No, these scofflaws end up behind bars because, wait for it, they have not paid court fines, probation fees, and even bills for being in jail in the first place. In other words, as states across the country, continue to impose fines and fees to people entangled in our criminal justice system, people who can’t pay sometimes find themselves locked away again. The problem has become so acute in so many communities that Sperling says our country has become quote, “A punitive debt trap for millions of low income Americans, essentially a debtor’s prison writ large”. But of course it is why cities and states have been raising these fees that is even more troubling. According to the article, the main reason fees have become so prohibitive is because they’re used to fund the same cops and courts that impose them. That’s right. As I said before, police and law enforcement monetize the people they arrest, charge and otherwise incarcerate so they can pay their own salary. So how could that go wrong? I mean, think about it. A system predicated on financializing criminal justice is basically a solution in search of a problem. A cop who knows his or her generous salary and pricey benefits are based on how many people end up in handcuffs is going to find as many ways to slap them on as many wrists as possible. A prosecutor or judge who knows court fees and criminal fines will pay for a cushy pension or lavish health benefits is surely going to search for as many ways to impose them as they can. The point is how can we trust a criminal justice system predicated upon profit? How can we literally trust a system that is using force and the threat of imprisonment to extract cash from the people it’s supposed to protect? I’m not sure what you call it, but it sounds like racketeering to me with a bit of communal extortion on the side. The worst part is that this power over our collective purse has no natural checks or balances. As we’ve seen again and again on this show, once a bad arrest is made, there are no repercussions for the officer or the department that allowed it. There are no charges or investigations into bad police behavior. Instead, even bad arrests end up a win for police with victims forced to pay court costs, lawyer fees and fines that accumulate usury interest if they aren’t paid off immediately. The point is we can’t have a criminal justice system that operates on the imperative of profit. Funding policing by the monetization of criminality takes the worst aspects of capitalism and the fascist impulses of a society obsessed with punishment and creates an anti-democratic stew so toxic, it could kill even the healthiest democracy. That’s why stories like the arrest of Anthony Holbrook must be told, and that’s why we won’t stop telling them. I would like to thank my guest Anthony Holbrook for joining me today. Anthony, thank you so much for your time. Anthony Holbrook: I was nervous, thank you. Taya Graham: And of course I would like to thank intrepid reporter, Stephen Janis for his editing, writing and reporting on this piece. Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Janis: Okay, Taya.

      " Content: Sunday, February 21st, 2021, marks the 56th anniversary of Malcolm X’s assassination. In this special segment from this week’s “Marc Steiner Show,” Marc has an in-depth conversation with Tamara Payne, co-author of the National Book Award-winning biography “The Dead Are Arising,” about the deep political and familial influences that helped Malcolm Little become Malcolm X. “The Dead Are Arising,” a book that gives a never-before-seen view of Malcolm’s life and legacy, was thirty years in the making, including thousands of original interviews and research by the late Les Payne, Tamara’s father, and Tamara herself. In this conversation, Marc and Payne discuss how the book expands our understanding of Malcolm X, as well as the process of putting the book together and seeing it through to publication. Listen to full podcast episodes of “The Marc Steiner Show.” Marc Steiner:  Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show, right here on The Real News Network. Good to have you all with us, as usual. I’m Marc Steiner. It was 56 years ago that Malcolm X was assassinated. It’s a moment I’ll never forget. I’ll also never forget standing in the frigid cold outside the church at the funeral with the speaker blaring Ossie Davis’s eulogy. And there’ve been numerous books, and of course The Autobiography of Malcolm X being one of them, that moved so many when they read the life of Malcolm X. There’s also Spike Lee’s biopic film, Malcolm X with Denzel Washington in the lead, which you can now see almost anywhere. And the play One Night in Miami, with a very different sense and portrayal of Malcolm and that you can see now on Amazon Prime. And I watched it the other night after seeing it in the theater. I keep a picture of Malcolm and Martin just above my desk. I think about those two men a lot, and wonder what we would think about this new amazing book that just came out about Malcolm called The Dead are Arising by the late Les Payne, written with his daughter Tamara Payne. This book brings us Malcolm that not so much dives into the depth of his politics, but brings us into the world that made Malcolm, from his childhood, his parents, the moments in his life — Many of which were lesser known by many — That led to the split with the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad, but different details of that that we don’t always see or talk about, the most chilling account of his assassination that I’ve ever read, and more. And it’s based on thousands of hours of intimate interviews put together over a 30-year period. When the great Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Les Payne left us much too soon and his daughter picked up the mantle and made sure the book was finished — As I said, she was also the lead researcher on the book and made this book happen and joins us now. And Tamara Payne, welcome, it’s good to have you with us. Tamara Payne:  Hello Marc, thank you for having me. Marc Steiner:  So where do we begin? Because I think about this book, and there’s very few things I’ve ever read that take Malcolm X from Malcolm Little to Malcolm X to Malik el-Shabazz with all these details and things. So how did this begin for your father? He was one of America’s great journalists, Pulitzer Prize winner, editor, incredible writer. This book just pulls you in like a novel the way he put the interviews together. So talk a bit about how you put this together and how you got these interviews it seems very few people bothered to get. Tamara Payne:  Thank you. I would like to start with, talk a little bit about my dad, who was born in 1941 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which was in Jim Crow South. And then his family moved up to Hartford, Connecticut when he was 12 years old. And he went to University of Connecticut in Storrs, and then after that went into the army in the Vietnam War and served as a… He was an information officer, and made it to army captain. He worked under General Westmoreland and wrote some of his speeches. And then after he came out of the army, he went into journalism, worked full-time with Newsday — Actually, with the help of an army buddy of his — And he stayed at Newsday for 38 years. But I say all that also to give a sense of who my father was and his experiences that are how he processes information. So when he’s writing about Jim Crow South, he’s actually writing about Jim Crow South from the first person experience. I can’t speak of what it was like to see my great-grandmother speak to a young white boy and to call him sir, and he referred to her by her first name. My father can. I think it’s important that people understand that speaking with our elders and learning from them is really important because they capture that history, and if we’re not careful, that history will come back. \n",

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always try to make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system which makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to achieve this goal by examining two examples of the theme we explore often on this show; the destructive consequences of American over-policing. First, by reporting on the arrest of a man seen here in this video, whose alleged crime was turning around when he spotted a cop. And then by reporting on the work of an international commission which is investigating police brutality in this country, which they believe is so exceptional it requires worldwide attention to fix. Taya Graham: But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please share it with us, and we might be able to investigate. You can reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter or Facebook, or you can email us privately at PAR@therealnews.com and share your evidence of police misconduct. And please don’t forget to like and comment on our videos, we really do appreciate it, and it helps, and I try to answer your questions when I can. Okay, that’s out of the way. Taya Graham: Now, as we’ve often reported on this show, there is a burgeoning problem affecting American law enforcement that does not get enough attention. It’s an issue that some evidence suggests may be behind many of the troubling police encounters we report on. Sometimes we call this over-policing, but I think it’s helpful to think of it from a different perspective, overcapacity. Since we live in a crony capitalist society where the monetization of public problems seem to be the preferred form of governance, why not use the same lexicon to point out its flaws? Because in town after town we have covered across the country, one truism has emerged from the myriad of minor arrests for seemingly fictitious crimes we’ve recounted. There are just too many cops. Taya Graham: And today, we have a striking example of that thesis from Talking Rock, Georgia. A troubling video of the pursuit of a man who simply turned his car around when he spotted an officer parked on a road, a decision that has led to a prolonged legal battle and troubling consequences for the man who made the decision to reverse course. Now, it’s worth noting that tensions between Georgia State Troopers and the residents of Talking Rock in North Georgia had been high since the police-involved killing of John Harley Turner. He was shot on his own property by troopers after local hunters claimed he was threatening them, but then Turner was shot by the police on his own property just 45 minutes later. Taya Graham: So tensions were high, to say the least, and that’s when Charles Spradling heard a trooper was staked out down the road from his house. He decided to drive to investigate, and now I’ll let him tell us what happened next. Charles Spradling: At the time, it was just a roadblock, and I was going down to see it because having the neighbor tell me that she saw it is not the same as seeing it for yourself, and I wanted to be able to make sure that I could say, “Yes, on this date and time, there was indeed a police roadblock on our road.” Now, our road is very rural, so it would be highly unlikely for the police to have a roadblock there, so it had to be related to the incident with my neighbor five minutes earlier. Taya Graham: And as you can see in this video, police pulled Spradling over, ordered him out of his car, and demanded to see his license. Let’s listen to what happened next. Charles Spradling: I have every legal right to be [inaudible 00:03:49]. Speaker 3: Well, you just… We’re doing a road check [crosstalk 00:03:52]. Charles Spradling: I heard you were doing a road check. [crosstalk 00:03:58]. I do have a license, here. Speaker 3: Okay. Charles Spradling: [inaudible 00:03:58]. I went down there because my neighbors complained that there was a roadblock on our street. I went down there to see what’s going on. Speaker 3: Okay. He wont give me his license. Charles Spradling: I live right here. Speaker 3: I want you to give me your license. [crosstalk 00:04:12]. Taya Graham: As you can see, police ultimately arrested Spradling, and since then they have embroiled him in a protracted legal battle. But before I get to my interview with him, I wanted to check in with my reporting partner, Stephen Janis to get some context on the case itself. Stephen, thank you for joining us. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: First, as mentioned at the beginning of the show, the conflict originated with the shooting of a resident by a Georgia state trooper. What’s the status of this case and were any of the officers arrested? Stephen Janis: Well, as far as I can tell from what I looked at, there was no investigation of the officers, no questioning of the officers, the shooting was immediately ruled justified. So really nothing was done. There was no aftermath or after action investigation or any sort of report posted online. It was pretty much considered to be an okay shooting, which is a little disturbing. Taya Graham: Now there’ve been quite a few rulings about the constitutional rights to avoid speed traps or police checkpoints. Tell us a little about that. Stephen Janis: Well, let me be clear. It is not a crime to turn around when you see a police checkpoint, nor is it probable cause to chase somebody or try to arrest them when they avoid a police checkpoint. What’s interesting about that is that most of these cases revolve around DUI checkpoints. This clearly wasn’t that at all. So why the police chased him and what probable cause or justification effort remains a mystery because they violated his fourth amendment rights clearly. Charles Spradling: So, Stephen, finally, what are the police saying about Charles Spradling’s case? How are they justifying the arrest in the light of the questions over its legality? Stephen Janis: Well, to be honest, I haven’t been able to get in touch with police about this, but it’s clear the prosecutor dropped the charges almost immediately, showing that really there was really no basis or probable cause for this arrest, or no reason for the police to [inaudible 00:05:50]. It’s clear from what I said before, about the constitutionality of avoiding a police checkpoint, there was no basis for this, so the charges really were bogus. Taya Graham: And now to get more on the details on what happened and the consequences for the person you’re seeing in this video, I’m joined by the man himself, Charles Spradling. Charles, thank you so much for joining us. Charles Spradling: Thank you for inviting me on the show. Taya Graham: First, can you please explain to us the traffic stop that we are seeing in this video? What was their pretext for stopping you? Charles Spradling: If you watch the video, and it depends on the time that you actually look at the video as to what the pretext is. Initially the stop was… Allegedly it was suspicious for me to turn around at the site of a checkpoint down the road. But when they found out later in the video that their sergeant told them that he thinks it’s okay to do that, then they started to come up with all sorts of other reasons that should be clearly seen in the video. Taya Graham: Now you had good reason for not wanting to have a direct encounter with police, in particular the officers who slapped the cuffs on you. Can you tell us what he did to your neighbor? Charles Spradling: The neighbor in question called me about the roadblock. They live on the other side. Their son was 34 years old at the time, and he was a naturalist. He loved the outdoors. Well, hunters and that tend to not mix. The hunters apparently were on his property, they were hunting. He yelled through the woods, told them to get off of his property, that he was going to come down and shoot if they didn’t basically. But it was through the woods, so he didn’t confront them face to face. Well, they left the property, they went and called the police. The police came out and they immediately drew their weapons because the neighbor was wearing a chest holster with a .45 in it. They told him on his own property, “Put the weapon down, put the weapon down.” And of course, he said, “I have every right to have this weapon. I’m on my own property. I want to go to bed. Leave me alone. Just keep the trespassers off my property.” Charles Spradling: But this went on for about 45 minutes. At one point, my neighbor even went back into his house and grabbed a gallon jug of water and in a flash he came back out. Well, unbeknownst to him while he was in the house, the police devised a plan to get him to come closer. So when he came out, the female deputy on the scene had asked him if she could have a drink of his water, because he was carrying his gallon jug. Charles Spradling: So he started to approach the fence to give her that drink of water. Well, he didn’t know, but two of the deputies had jumped over the fence onto their property and were hiding and waiting for him. So when he got close enough to her to give her the water, then they opened fire with bean bag rounds at that point. And of course, he drew his weapon and fired back. He didn’t shoot any of them, but they let loose over a hundred rounds, ended up killing him. Taya Graham: That seems like that didn’t have to happen, that there was no need to escalate the encounter. Charles Spradling: Well, I agree with that. The problem we have is that that law enforcement don’t see things the same way as the citizens do, they just don’t. And they think that their word is to be obeyed under all circumstances, notwithstanding the law. And that’s the problem. Taya Graham: Now let’s take another look at the video. You asked to see the supervisor and you were placed in the back and the officers begin discussing what to do with you. What did they say to each other and during their call to their supervisor? Charles Spradling: Well, keep in mind at the time, I couldn’t hear this. So I’m locked in the back of the cage with handcuffs on and they’re discussing that he thinks it’s okay to turn around at checkpoint so they need to find probable cause to have stopped me. So the first thing one of the troopers looks at is the tire. He says “The tires are down to the [inaudible 00:09:56].” Speaker 3: He says we’re violating his rights, he’s got a weapon in the car. [inaudible 00:10:00]. Because he turned around and went the opposite way. It’s valid, but I know in Atlanta [inaudible 00:10:12] turn around and run. [inaudible 00:10:12]. Charles Spradling: So they bring up the window tint. The window tint looks a little dark, but that was 14 minutes of course after he had handcuffs put on me. Taya Graham: Did you give permission for the search of your car? In your estimation, were your civil rights violated? I mean, where do you think the officers crossed the line? Charles Spradling: At that particular time, I was in the back of the car for 20 to 30 minutes before they finally come back and told me that I was “officially under arrest.” At that point it was a failure to display, obstruction of justice and faulty tires. So they claimed my tires were in the state. So I was taken to jail. I had to post about $2,700 in bond to get out of jail. So I was in jail for several hours until we worked that out. You know how easy that is on a Saturday afternoon after 4:00. They towed my car out of my driveway after searching it completely. They went to the glove box and the center console, they even ran the serial number on my firearm multiple times during the stop. I had a backpack in the back of the vehicle, they went completely through that. Charles Spradling: Ironically, they ended up giving my wife several of the possessions that were in the vehicle, including the firearm, but they refused to let her take the car the remaining distance up the driveway to the house. This was on Saturday. So on Monday morning, first thing I have to get up is go and get my car. You got to pay cash. They don’t accept credit cards when they’re impounds. So I drove down to get my car. From there, I drove over to my attorney’s office. I explained to him pretty much what I’ve said here on this video and his response to me was, “Okay, what else aren’t you telling me?” Which is like, no, that was really it. There was nothing I was hiding. So he arranged to have a preliminary hearing about three weeks from that date. The judge pretty much threw it all out. They dropped it like an affidavit. Taya Graham: Now on this show, we’ve spoken a lot about over-policing in particular in rural America. Do you think this is an example of it and is it really a problem? Charles Spradling: I think we’re over-policing everywhere, unfortunately. I don’t think it’s just rural America. I think a lot of these big city police officers are running into problems inside the cities and some of these bigger departments, and they’re coming out to the rural communities and they’re bringing their problems with them. I think that’s what’s really going on. And we’re just seeing it to where the power a police officer carries when he confronts somebody in public is intoxicating, and they get so used to that and they’re so accustomed to people praising them, worshiping everything that they do that when somebody says, wait a minute, you can’t do that. They don’t know how to handle it. Taya Graham: So how has this ordeal affected you? Can you talk a little bit about the personal toll for you? Charles Spradling: I’ve never been one to suffer an injustice lightly, it’s always affected me pretty heavily. This, it shocked me beyond the pale because I knew I had done nothing wrong. I was very careful that I don’t have anything illegal, my insurance is up to date, my registration, everything is proper. I live that way. So when I was stopped, I was taken back a little bit. It was like why I was being stopped in the first place? I turned around, it was more than a [inaudible 00:13:55] of a mile before the checkpoint. So I wasn’t even in the checkpoint region. Charles Spradling: But it took me back that, wow, if they can do this and what I have to go through to have my day in court that they like to tell you to go for, then what does a person who has the most minor infraction registration that may not be properly type or they could be a type or something doesn’t perfectly match, what chance do they have? Like I said, in my case, I don’t think they have anything they can come back on, and they’re really struggling with that. In fact, right now their story is that they arrested me from the very second they put the handcuffs on me. It was a full arrest even though they denied it multiple times both in the video and in the preliminary hearing. Charles Spradling: All of a sudden they’re changing their story now because they couldn’t get past, I believe, pulling my wallet out of my back pocket with objection. So the police get to redefine their narrative and they do it and they do it over and over again. And they know that we as citizens are going to have to spend thousands of dollars on legal fees to answer every one of their narratives. And if we do, then they’ll just change it and there goes another few thousand dollars. Taya Graham: Now, the reason we report on cases like this week after week is twofold. One, we want to be helpful to hundreds of people who reach out to us for assistance when facing unfair or unjust law enforcement. And two, we want to apply the specific to the general. Meaning we want to use these stories to paint a larger, more informed picture of the state of American policing, and nothing could be more exemplary of that idea than the case we just reported om, and by extension a conference which took place a few weeks ago, focused upon the use of force by American police. Keep in mind, American police use deadly force more often, and with more lethal consequences than almost any other country on earth. For example, cops in Australia kill as many people in 30 years as American cops shoot in one month. Granted the populations of both countries are quite disproportionate, but you get the idea. Taya Graham: And it’s our ongoing problem with the over use of force that was the topic of an international commission specially created and then paneled to investigate and report on the use of deadly force in this country. The commission took testimony from lawyers, family members and law enforcement officials who expressed concern about how many people die at the hands of cops. The panel examined controversial police killings like Tamir Rice, a 14 year old boy who was shot and killed by Cleveland Police while playing in a park with a toy gun. Or Tyrone West, a Baltimore City resident who was beaten by police for nearly an hour after he made a U-turn, and Brionna Taylor, the young nurse who was killed during a botched drug raid last year. Taya Graham: The point is that American law enforcement kill so many people in so many ways, and so often those same cops are rarely punished that it has required an outside body to intervene. In other words, American style policing is so extraordinarily brutal that in order to address it, we have to venture beyond the borders of the country which allows it. But that’s not where the excesses end, because this just released report by the investigative news site ProPublica exposed how deeply rooted all the aforementioned ills are embedded in our system of crony capitalism. Taya Graham: The award-winning journalism organization analyzed the contracts of New Jersey police officers looking for perks that led to extraordinary payouts. The group found that police there received a whopping $492 million for unused sick leave over the past several years. Payout so generous that some officers collected hundreds of thousands of dollars each in unused sick leave. Taya Graham: Now, let’s remember that during the most recent negotiations over the COVID relief package, negotiators specifically excluded a clause that would have guaranteed sick leave to American workers. The measure was dropped after republicans protested that the benefit would be too costly and the democrats failed to successfully craft and pass a bill that addresses the needs of an increasingly desperate electorate. Nevermind, we were in the middle of a deadly pandemic and nevermind that this sick leave is essential to keep all of us healthy. Taya Graham: But instead of affording a critical benefit to all of us, states like New Jersey have set aside half a billion dollars in wait for it, unused sick leave. That is while denying grocery store workers, cab drivers, retailers a right to a basic and life-saving benefit. State officials have made sure that police can cash in their unused sick pay like a taxpayer funded slush fund. In other words, cops get sick pay they don’t need or use, and we the people get nothing. Taya Graham: Considering this divide between the perk showered on police and the basic necessities denied the rest of us, is there any wonder we see stories like the one we featured in today’s show? Is it surprising that police make bogus arrests and use force under questionable circumstances? Are we really shocked when cops enforce punitive laws without reasonable discretion, all of which results with more of us riding away in jail? I think it’s the divide between the pricey perks for them and very little for us that reveals the true imperative of American policing. How US law enforcement has become a veritable Praetorian guard, the for-rent soldiers who defended Roman emperors and their unfettered wealth for a price. They are better paid and better protected from the laws in ways not afforded to the rest of us. In exchange they are tasked with enforcing economic inequality, not justice. Taya Graham: They can cash out sick pay while we are forced to work during a pandemic because they perform the valuable service of enforcing all the social boundaries that make inequality possible. That my friends is why we continue to see law enforcement officers paid outrageous salaries and receive plenty of perks the rest of us will never get. That is also why an international tribunal is actually forced to take on American law enforcement’s catastrophic brutality while our own leaders stand back and watch. Taya Graham: The truth is American policing has evolved in ways that have little to do with public safety or service instead has become a self-serving institution that feeds at the trough of American excess, a job that has been transformed by the influence of rapacious crony capitalism into an enforcer of the inherent unfairness which unfortunately engulfs us all.

Please be safe out there. In this week’s PAR, Taya Graham and Stephen Janis continue their ongoing investigation into small-town overpolicing by reporting on the case of Charles Spradling. Spradling was supposedly stopped for avoiding a police roadblock, then Georgia State Troopers searched his car without consent and arrested him on dubious charges. While Spradling struggles to have his day in court, some residents of Talking Rock, Georgia, say that the pattern of overpolicing in their rural area is undeniable.

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always try to make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system which makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to achieve this goal by examining two examples of the theme we explore often on this show; the destructive consequences of American over-policing. First, by reporting on the arrest of a man seen here in this video, whose alleged crime was turning around when he spotted a cop. And then by reporting on the work of an international commission which is investigating police brutality in this country, which they believe is so exceptional it requires worldwide attention to fix. Taya Graham: But before I get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct or brutality, please share it with us, and we might be able to investigate. You can reach out to me directly @tayasbaltimore on Twitter or Facebook, or you can email us privately at PAR@therealnews.com and share your evidence of police misconduct. And please don’t forget to like and comment on our videos, we really do appreciate it, and it helps, and I try to answer your questions when I can. Okay, that’s out of the way. Taya Graham: Now, as we’ve often reported on this show, there is a burgeoning problem affecting American law enforcement that does not get enough attention. It’s an issue that some evidence suggests may be behind many of the troubling police encounters we report on. Sometimes we call this over-policing, but I think it’s helpful to think of it from a different perspective, overcapacity. Since we live in a crony capitalist society where the monetization of public problems seem to be the preferred form of governance, why not use the same lexicon to point out its flaws? Because in town after town we have covered across the country, one truism has emerged from the myriad of minor arrests for seemingly fictitious crimes we’ve recounted. There are just too many cops. Taya Graham: And today, we have a striking example of that thesis from Talking Rock, Georgia. A troubling video of the pursuit of a man who simply turned his car around when he spotted an officer parked on a road, a decision that has led to a prolonged legal battle and troubling consequences for the man who made the decision to reverse course. Now, it’s worth noting that tensions between Georgia State Troopers and the residents of Talking Rock in North Georgia had been high since the police-involved killing of John Harley Turner. He was shot on his own property by troopers after local hunters claimed he was threatening them, but then Turner was shot by the police on his own property just 45 minutes later. Taya Graham: So tensions were high, to say the least, and that’s when Charles Spradling heard a trooper was staked out down the road from his house. He decided to drive to investigate, and now I’ll let him tell us what happened next. Charles Spradling: At the time, it was just a roadblock, and I was going down to see it because having the neighbor tell me that she saw it is not the same as seeing it for yourself, and I wanted to be able to make sure that I could say, “Yes, on this date and time, there was indeed a police roadblock on our road.” Now, our road is very rural, so it would be highly unlikely for the police to have a roadblock there, so it had to be related to the incident with my neighbor five minutes earlier. Taya Graham: And as you can see in this video, police pulled Spradling over, ordered him out of his car, and demanded to see his license. Let’s listen to what happened next. Charles Spradling: I have every legal right to be [inaudible 00:03:49]. Speaker 3: Well, you just… We’re doing a road check [crosstalk 00:03:52]. Charles Spradling: I heard you were doing a road check. [crosstalk 00:03:58]. I do have a license, here. Speaker 3: Okay. Charles Spradling: [inaudible 00:03:58]. I went down there because my neighbors complained that there was a roadblock on our street. I went down there to see what’s going on. Speaker 3: Okay. He wont give me his license. Charles Spradling: I live right here. Speaker 3: I want you to give me your license. [crosstalk 00:04:12]. Taya Graham: As you can see, police ultimately arrested Spradling, and since then they have embroiled him in a protracted legal battle. But before I get to my interview with him, I wanted to check in with my reporting partner, Stephen Janis to get some context on the case itself. Stephen, thank you for joining us. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: First, as mentioned at the beginning of the show, the conflict originated with the shooting of a resident by a Georgia state trooper. What’s the status of this case and were any of the officers arrested? Stephen Janis: Well, as far as I can tell from what I looked at, there was no investigation of the officers, no questioning of the officers, the shooting was immediately ruled justified. So really nothing was done. There was no aftermath or after action investigation or any sort of report posted online. It was pretty much considered to be an okay shooting, which is a little disturbing. Taya Graham: Now there’ve been quite a few rulings about the constitutional rights to avoid speed traps or police checkpoints. Tell us a little about that. Stephen Janis: Well, let me be clear. It is not a crime to turn around when you see a police checkpoint, nor is it probable cause to chase somebody or try to arrest them when they avoid a police checkpoint. What’s interesting about that is that most of these cases revolve around DUI checkpoints. This clearly wasn’t that at all. So why the police chased him and what probable cause or justification effort remains a mystery because they violated his fourth amendment rights clearly. Charles Spradling: So, Stephen, finally, what are the police saying about Charles Spradling’s case? How are they justifying the arrest in the light of the questions over its legality? Stephen Janis: Well, to be honest, I haven’t been able to get in touch with police about this, but it’s clear the prosecutor dropped the charges almost immediately, showing that really there was really no basis or probable cause for this arrest, or no reason for the police to [inaudible 00:05:50]. It’s clear from what I said before, about the constitutionality of avoiding a police checkpoint, there was no basis for this, so the charges really were bogus. Taya Graham: And now to get more on the details on what happened and the consequences for the person you’re seeing in this video, I’m joined by the man himself, Charles Spradling. Charles, thank you so much for joining us. Charles Spradling: Thank you for inviting me on the show. Taya Graham: First, can you please explain to us the traffic stop that we are seeing in this video? What was their pretext for stopping you? Charles Spradling: If you watch the video, and it depends on the time that you actually look at the video as to what the pretext is. Initially the stop was… Allegedly it was suspicious for me to turn around at the site of a checkpoint down the road. But when they found out later in the video that their sergeant told them that he thinks it’s okay to do that, then they started to come up with all sorts of other reasons that should be clearly seen in the video. Taya Graham: Now you had good reason for not wanting to have a direct encounter with police, in particular the officers who slapped the cuffs on you. Can you tell us what he did to your neighbor? Charles Spradling: The neighbor in question called me about the roadblock. They live on the other side. Their son was 34 years old at the time, and he was a naturalist. He loved the outdoors. Well, hunters and that tend to not mix. The hunters apparently were on his property, they were hunting. He yelled through the woods, told them to get off of his property, that he was going to come down and shoot if they didn’t basically. But it was through the woods, so he didn’t confront them face to face. Well, they left the property, they went and called the police. The police came out and they immediately drew their weapons because the neighbor was wearing a chest holster with a .45 in it. They told him on his own property, “Put the weapon down, put the weapon down.” And of course, he said, “I have every right to have this weapon. I’m on my own property. I want to go to bed. Leave me alone. Just keep the trespassers off my property.” Charles Spradling: But this went on for about 45 minutes. At one point, my neighbor even went back into his house and grabbed a gallon jug of water and in a flash he came back out. Well, unbeknownst to him while he was in the house, the police devised a plan to get him to come closer. So when he came out, the female deputy on the scene had asked him if she could have a drink of his water, because he was carrying his gallon jug. Charles Spradling: So he started to approach the fence to give her that drink of water. Well, he didn’t know, but two of the deputies had jumped over the fence onto their property and were hiding and waiting for him. So when he got close enough to her to give her the water, then they opened fire with bean bag rounds at that point. And of course, he drew his weapon and fired back. He didn’t shoot any of them, but they let loose over a hundred rounds, ended up killing him. Taya Graham: That seems like that didn’t have to happen, that there was no need to escalate the encounter. Charles Spradling: Well, I agree with that. The problem we have is that that law enforcement don’t see things the same way as the citizens do, they just don’t. And they think that their word is to be obeyed under all circumstances, notwithstanding the law. And that’s the problem. Taya Graham: Now let’s take another look at the video. You asked to see the supervisor and you were placed in the back and the officers begin discussing what to do with you. What did they say to each other and during their call to their supervisor? Charles Spradling: Well, keep in mind at the time, I couldn’t hear this. So I’m locked in the back of the cage with handcuffs on and they’re discussing that he thinks it’s okay to turn around at checkpoint so they need to find probable cause to have stopped me. So the first thing one of the troopers looks at is the tire. He says “The tires are down to the [inaudible 00:09:56].” Speaker 3: He says we’re violating his rights, he’s got a weapon in the car. [inaudible 00:10:00]. Because he turned around and went the opposite way. It’s valid, but I know in Atlanta [inaudible 00:10:12] turn around and run. [inaudible 00:10:12]. Charles Spradling: So they bring up the window tint. The window tint looks a little dark, but that was 14 minutes of course after he had handcuffs put on me. Taya Graham: Did you give permission for the search of your car? In your estimation, were your civil rights violated? I mean, where do you think the officers crossed the line? Charles Spradling: At that particular time, I was in the back of the car for 20 to 30 minutes before they finally come back and told me that I was “officially under arrest.” At that point it was a failure to display, obstruction of justice and faulty tires. So they claimed my tires were in the state. So I was taken to jail. I had to post about $2,700 in bond to get out of jail. So I was in jail for several hours until we worked that out. You know how easy that is on a Saturday afternoon after 4:00. They towed my car out of my driveway after searching it completely. They went to the glove box and the center console, they even ran the serial number on my firearm multiple times during the stop. I had a backpack in the back of the vehicle, they went completely through that. Charles Spradling: Ironically, they ended up giving my wife several of the possessions that were in the vehicle, including the firearm, but they refused to let her take the car the remaining distance up the driveway to the house. This was on Saturday. So on Monday morning, first thing I have to get up is go and get my car. You got to pay cash. They don’t accept credit cards when they’re impounds. So I drove down to get my car. From there, I drove over to my attorney’s office. I explained to him pretty much what I’ve said here on this video and his response to me was, “Okay, what else aren’t you telling me?” Which is like, no, that was really it. There was nothing I was hiding. So he arranged to have a preliminary hearing about three weeks from that date. The judge pretty much threw it all out. They dropped it like an affidavit. Taya Graham: Now on this show, we’ve spoken a lot about over-policing in particular in rural America. Do you think this is an example of it and is it really a problem? Charles Spradling: I think we’re over-policing everywhere, unfortunately. I don’t think it’s just rural America. I think a lot of these big city police officers are running into problems inside the cities and some of these bigger departments, and they’re coming out to the rural communities and they’re bringing their problems with them. I think that’s what’s really going on. And we’re just seeing it to where the power a police officer carries when he confronts somebody in public is intoxicating, and they get so used to that and they’re so accustomed to people praising them, worshiping everything that they do that when somebody says, wait a minute, you can’t do that. They don’t know how to handle it. Taya Graham: So how has this ordeal affected you? Can you talk a little bit about the personal toll for you? Charles Spradling: I’ve never been one to suffer an injustice lightly, it’s always affected me pretty heavily. This, it shocked me beyond the pale because I knew I had done nothing wrong. I was very careful that I don’t have anything illegal, my insurance is up to date, my registration, everything is proper. I live that way. So when I was stopped, I was taken back a little bit. It was like why I was being stopped in the first place? I turned around, it was more than a [inaudible 00:13:55] of a mile before the checkpoint. So I wasn’t even in the checkpoint region. Charles Spradling: But it took me back that, wow, if they can do this and what I have to go through to have my day in court that they like to tell you to go for, then what does a person who has the most minor infraction registration that may not be properly type or they could be a type or something doesn’t perfectly match, what chance do they have? Like I said, in my case, I don’t think they have anything they can come back on, and they’re really struggling with that. In fact, right now their story is that they arrested me from the very second they put the handcuffs on me. It was a full arrest even though they denied it multiple times both in the video and in the preliminary hearing. Charles Spradling: All of a sudden they’re changing their story now because they couldn’t get past, I believe, pulling my wallet out of my back pocket with objection. So the police get to redefine their narrative and they do it and they do it over and over again. And they know that we as citizens are going to have to spend thousands of dollars on legal fees to answer every one of their narratives. And if we do, then they’ll just change it and there goes another few thousand dollars. Taya Graham: Now, the reason we report on cases like this week after week is twofold.

      " Content: Marc Steiner: Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show, here on The Real News, and I’m Marc Steiner. It’s good to have you with us. And as you know, on this program I have been covering issues in Palestine and Israel for a long time, and there is no better time than the present to wrestle with what’s going on. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic grips the world in its horrible deadly grasp, it brings into sharp focus the inequities of wealth and power between the developed world and those mired in poverty and lack of power in the developing world. And in few places is it more stunning or geographically close than between Israel, the occupied territories and the besieged Gaza Strip. And that’s what we’re going to focus on today. Marc Steiner: And Israel has one of the finest healthcare systems in the entire planet. Its responses to COVID-19, within Israel itself, has been a beacon to many countries around the world about how to proceed. Yet Palestinians in the occupied territories and in Gaza are facing an epidemic disaster in large part because Israel denied vaccines and assistance to the Palestinian Authority. Saying it’s not their, not Israel’s, responsibility. That they have no responsibility under the Oslo Accords that were done in the early 1990s, and that Gaza is what it is because it’s under siege, blockaded by Israel and Egypt, so it receives little or nothing, even while settlers on the West Bank are being vaccinated in the occupied territories. So it begs a lot of questions which we’re going to try to explore today. COVID has just laid bare, in startling relief, why efforts to end the occupation and force resolution between Palestinians and Israelis should be at the top of the agenda for this new Biden Harris administration. And that’s a much larger conversation, but it needs to be said. Marc Steiner: So we’re joined today by our two guests. Dr. Osama Tanous is a physician, a pediatrician, based in Haifa, now studying and working on his fellowship in Atlanta. He has a master’s degree in public health and is an Al-Shabaka policy analyst and has recently written these two really interesting articles on the COVID crisis that I read. One was for Al-Jazeera, and the other for 972. So welcome for the first time. Good to have you with us. Marc Steiner: And, Lia Tarachansky, a former Real News correspondent in Palestine and Israel who produced many incredible programs for us, is an award-winning film-maker and journalist who grew up in the occupied territories in a settlement and produced films like On the Side of the Road and one of her newer pieces, Ethnocracy: Israel’s African Refugees, among many others. And Lia, welcome back. Good to have you with us. Lia Tarachansky: Thanks, Marc. Marc Steiner: So let me just begin with one of the things you wrote about, Osama, was the question of structural violence and how it plays itself out during this COVID crisis. Could you just begin there for us and talk about what that means? Osama Tanous: Yes. Well, thank you for having me, Mike, and hi, Lia. Marc. Well, I think what’s important for a lot of the audience in the US, or generally in the Western world, that see all the headlines about Israel Palestine but don’t really know all of the historical background that people talk about them as if they are two neighboring countries or two countries that have dispute over borders, and the thing is that is completely not the case. So when we talk about the West Bank and the occupied Gaza Strip, these are fake geographical entities that were created by Israel, by colonial frontier expansion. So there is no clear border to where Israel begins and where Israel ends, because you have settlements, you have the wall and then claiming the annexation of settlements, and then the besieges of Gaza Strip. So it’s important to keep in mind that while Israel as a settler-colonial project was being established and expanding, that has created the artificial borders that came to be the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Osama Tanous: These geographical entities are not countries, they are not islands, they are not out there, and they were created by Israel, and then they became a place to host refugees that were expelled from ’48 Palestine. So it’s very important to go back to ’48 in order to understand what has happened. Since then the West Bank and Gaza has been military occupied by Israel, along with the Golan Heights and Sinai later on. And the international law that forces the occupation to hold responsibility for the population it occupies in terms of providing them with healthcare, it is meant in order to make occupation not a long-standing issue. It is created in order to make occupation a hard task, because you don’t only occupy these populations but you have to provide them with healthcare until the occupation, as a temporary state of mind, is supposed to end. Right? Osama Tanous: So that has prolonged and then that has produced the Oslo Accords, which was supposed to bring an end to the occupation but it did not, because Israel still controls basically the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in terms of sovereignty over land, military occupation checkpoints, import, export. So the Palestinians are not independent in any way, and then they cannot establish, when you don’t have sovereignty over the ground, sovereignty over your land, your territorial borders, your airports or ports. You cannot establish a healthcare system in that sense, and this is why the healthcare system in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is so weak, because it’s basically fragmented between governmental institution, NGOs, UNRWA and so on. Osama Tanous: And Israel always goes back and forth between the claim that it has no obligation towards the Palestinian at all, because you have the PA that is responsible, to saying that Israel, although having no obligation, it fulfills its humanitarian obligations. So it’s very easy to swing back and forth without defining, and these are the origins of the true problems that we see in COVID but have been there with everything, with dealing with heart disease, with cancer, with any kind of disease in the West Bank and Gaza. Marc Steiner: So you’ve laid out a lot here, and let me parse some of this through. And Lia, one of the things that struck me about this whole thing we’re going through at the moment is that, on the one hand, Israel is saying it has no responsibility to the occupied territories because of the Oslo accords of 1993 and ’95, and then some others I’ve seen have written pieces saying, “But look, we’re not discriminating because we take care of the Arab citizens of Israel. The Palestinians inside of Israel.” But to me the glaring contradiction here is how if you look at the Geneva Accords, Israel is allowing death to take place and this epidemic to surge among Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza. So I mean, help parse this out, both politically and emotionally. Lia Tarachansky: Well, I think if you are going to be looking at international law as a framework in which to understand the actions of Israeli’s [inaudible 00:07:51], you’re going to be very disappointed, because Israel has followed international law only when it suits its own purpose, like so many other countries. And it’s not just to do with Palestinians. For example, the Jewish refugees who survived the Holocaust, and Israel itself, were the driving force behind the 1951 UN convention on the rights of the refugees. And yet, Israel having created now the longest-standing refugee crisis in the world, having African refugees at its doors, has completely ignored that convention, even though it was instrumental in bringing it about. So, I think that the mistake you’re making is looking at it international law and saying, “Hey look, Israel violated it again.” I mean, it’s not really a mistake, but it’s just to going to give you many answers. Lia Tarachansky: I think that what we’re looking at right now is a very sobering reminder that every aspect of care for the masses is a political decision. The Israeli government has been using COVID for its political purposes since the very beginning. Not just vis-a-vis the Palestinians but also vis-a-vis Israelis. In the beginning the response was very good. They shut down the country very quickly. The spread was almost halted completely in its tracks, and then when the criminal prosecutions against the prime minister became frontline news again, suddenly the lockdown is canceled, and COVID is no longer a big deal, and people go out into the streets and spread is astronomical. Right? Lia Tarachansky: So the government has been using COVID cynically for political purposes, like so many other countries. Right now, I’m doing a PhD in Canada, and here we have the vaccine now, and it’s being rolled out in three phases, and the first phase is essential workers, doctors on the frontline, people like that, and the only other exception is indigenous peoples. So Canada made a political, conscious decision to first of all take care of those people who its existence has historically marginalized and oppressed. Israel has done the exact opposite, because Israel is completely ignoring the fact that it’s a flagrant settler-colonial state that is engaged in constant absolute race against apartheid in an attempt to expel and exclude and gerrymander various ways in order to minimize the non-Jewish population of the country. And COVID is just another one of those examples. Lia Tarachansky: I think that it’s gotten so much attention, and I’m very glad it did, is because COVID is now something that all us around the world experience. Every single person in the world has a relationship with the COVID pandemic, and suddenly the experience of not having the vaccine, not because it doesn’t exist, but because, for cynical political reasons, it’s being withheld from you by a powerful state, one of the most powerful armies in the world, a nuclear power, a regional hegemony, economically massive state that’s receiving billions of dollars in aid and in trade. And to have that kind of state withheld a vaccine from a population that’s been battered down for so long and kept on the edge of poverty for so long, for political cynical reasons, I think that’s so stark right now. So unbelievable. So unexplainable that that’s whey you’re seeing so much attention being paid to it. What we’re looking at right now is a very sobering reminder that every aspect of care for the masses is a political decision. The Israeli government has been using COVID for its political purposes since the very beginning.  Marc Steiner: So let’s talk for a moment about what’s really happening here. There was a interesting quote that I found by Omar Shakir from Human Rights Watch. He said that after 50 years of occupation with no end in sight Israel’s duties go beyond offering spare doses. And so the question of what can be done with all this? I mean, everything I’ve read, both in some of the Arab press and in some of the Israeli press, is that COVID is spreading like wildfire in Gaza, though we have no real statistics, and it’s also devastating parts of the West Bank where Palestinians live. And you also on top of that have the new ruling by the International Criminal Court saying Israel can be investigated and brought up on charges because of human rights abuse in the occupied territories, and this could be added to that, if it spreads even more. So the question is where do you both think this goes politically? What happens now? I mean, unless I’m missing it, I’m not seeing a lot of- Lia Tarachansky: Well… Marc Steiner: Go ahead. Lia, go ahead. You were about to say what? Lia Tarachansky: Yeah, about 12 years ago I had the privilege of interviewing the woman who is now the head of the ICC, and 12 years ago I was asking her, “Israel has just bombarded the Gaza Strip in Operation Cast Lead. There’s so much evidence that it violated so many different international laws. When are you going to prosecute Israel? When are you going to prosecute Israel?” And they were on the edge of it back then, 12 yeas ago, and Israel has thrown everything in its power in order to halt and sabotage the process. Lia Tarachansky: Unfortunately, so did the Palestinian Authority, but at the moment now, what we’re seeing is that the lovers of justice have finally succeeded in getting to the point where the ICC has, not just the legal justification to prosecute Israel, but also now the political protection and ability to do so, and I think that that’s a very interesting development. Lia Tarachansky: Unfortunately, Israel is not a signature to the Rome Statute, and so therefore anything that the ICC does do will only apply to the actions of Israeli citizens working in the Palestinian territories. So it would be very, very, very limited, and the high level criminals might get away in exchange for low level war criminals like soldiers on the ground getting their punishment, but I do think that this is a very positive development, because if we do not have accountability, international law is meaningless. Marc Steiner: Did you want to add to that at all, Osama, before I move on? Osama Tanous: Yeah, I think it would be very naïve, this whole assumption that Israel is a normal democratic country that is misbehaving, that commits crimes here and there, and then it can be punished here and there or be taught to correct its behavior and then behave normally with the Palestinians it occupies. This is really too simplistic and naïve, and it completely ignores that Israel, per definition, per excellence, it was defined by excluding Palestinians, by defining who is Israeli by who is not Jewish. And then expelling the vast majority of Palestinians, creating these pockets to concentrate refugees, whether it’s the West Bank and Gaza and then occupy these territories and so on. Osama Tanous: And we shouldn’t aim at thinking how can we provide a better life condition under occupation. How can we make the Gaza Strip or the West Bank… Pump them with money, and pump them with medical care and equipment and NGOs. People have the right to live free everywhere. And also for Palestinians inside Israel, everybody has the right to live free under a country of all its citizens. A secular, democratic state that provides equality for everyone, and that can be achieved only through decolonization of the entire place, from the river to the sea. Osama Tanous: And what seems a very normal thing anywhere. That a country is the state of its citizens, not a state of part of its citizens and of people who are outside of its territory but can become automatically citizens, right? This does not make any sense, so in order to truly make also a better health for everyone and equity and equality in health and in politics, we need to achieve to that kind of solution. And the tools can vary, whether it’s the ICC or other tools, but we shouldn’t aim at creating better life condition under Israeli law. Marc Steiner: So let me stay with you for a moment, Osama. We’ll bring Lia right back in as we conclude. You’re a physician. You practice for the most part in Haifa in Israel, and I’m curious what you have heard from colleagues, from friends, who are working in the occupied territories or the West Bank and in Gaza, about what the situation is and what’s been happening, even with this trickling in of some vaccines are being allowed in. The Israelis are allowing in a modicum of vaccines for some health workers. Russia is supposed to be sending their vaccines in but not enough. So talk about what you know about what the current situation is. Osama Tanous: Yeah, so I mainly work in Haifa, but I’ve had the chance of working also in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip on volunteering with Physicians for Human Rights, so I quite got to know the medical system also in these places, and it’s just a whole mishmash of disorganized network. When there is no social contract between the people and the government, and you don’t know exactly who is in charge of your health, who is giving you health insurance, who is your health provider? So people tend to try to maneuver their way to whatever is possible, whether it’s a governmental hospital, the UNRWA hospital, for profit or try to get permits to go to Israel. So people with anything that happens, you’re always under stress because you want to make the best out of that, and sometimes you’ll have to cross military checkpoint and be politically pressured in order to get a permission. Osama Tanous: And, of course, there is a lot of frustration and anger with the function of the PA, right, because the Palestinian Authority is also a product of the Oslo process. It’s a by-product of the occupation, so it doesn’t truly fulfill its job in ensuring the best medical care for Palestinians. And this is not just about COVID, right, because we have to remember that Palestinians on average live 10 years less than Israelis. They die more of every possible disease, and after COVID is over they will return to die more from a heart attack, from heart diseases, from kidney diseases or any other preventable disease, right? And this is why people are so frustrated, but they don’t know anything else. Osama Tanous: This has been the case for 70 years or more, and these kinds of deaths are not… How can we say it? They are not theatrical. It’s not like bombardment. It’s nothing that you see on the news when people die from bombing. It’s nothing spectacular. So, it’s just an ongoing way of misery, of preventable death, of frustration and anger when the electricity shuts down in Gaza, and then the hospital has to go to a generator, or when there is a military checkpoint so the ambulance cannot pass. If you’re a Palestinian physician, you will also probably try to go abroad and live in a better condition, so it’s an entire system that is engineered to make your life much more harder and much more miserable. Pre-COVID, during COVID and post-COVID, right? And this is what frustrates so many physicians and practicing people in the West Bank and Gaza. Marc Steiner: So, Lia, unless you want to jump in on commentary on that. We’d love to hear what you think, but I’m also curious why there’s so little uproar inside of Israel itself about all of this. Lia Tarachansky: Well, it’s not a mystery. I mean, since COVID has been used so clearly for political purposes in Israel, we’ve seen a very exciting movement, a very powerful protest movement against the government, against Netanyahu specifically. People have been protesting by the masses every day since basically early spring, and that’s very interesting, and that’s very exciting. However, they are completely silent about what’s going on vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and it’s not because they’re heartless colonizers who are sub-human in some way, but it’s because they don’t know. And because the whole system is… while it’s very evident, it’s also incredibly obscured. I grew up in Israel. I grew up in the middle of the West Bank in a settlement, and I had my first conversation with a Palestinian when I came to do university in Canada. So the system is built in a way that constantly segregates in a very conscious way- Marc Steiner: That’s pretty stunning, Lia, what you just said, though. I mean, that’s very stunning, what you just said. I didn’t mean to stop you, because you were on a flow, but that you had not met a Palestinian till you got to Canada. I mean, that just made me stop for a second. I forgot [crosstalk 00:21:39]. Lia Tarachansky: Right. I mean, in the American South during Jim Crow, when you look at segregation during slavery, white people and black people are in the same space, but are they interacting? Do they know about each other’s lives? Do they have any real understanding of what the other lives like? No, because the whites created that system for the benefit of the whites and exclude, through violence and constant oppression, the blacks. It’s the same in Israel. Israel’s an apartheid system. It’s a version of modern day Jim Crow. It’s a very brutal system, and that oppression can only really continue en masse in a country where there’s a draft of people going to the army, if you are constantly obscuring it and justifying it. Lia Tarachansky: So I would say that the Israelis see once in a while the once of a hundred thousand Palestinians whose suffering is brought into an Israeli hospital. Like, for example, a few years ago I was covering the story of Muhammed [Zaza 00:22:38], who was a 15 year old kid in Gaza who was playing with his 12 year old cousin, Ibrahim, and Israel dropped a missile on them, killed Ibrahim, and then the Israeli government brought Muhammed into Israel to treat him. He underwent 20 surgeries. He lost his cousin. Lia Tarachansky: In a later war, Israel accidentally bombed his house. His father had to come to Israel to take care of him in the hospital, and so the family had no income. They fell so far into poverty that it had a whole chain, decade of consequences, but because that one kid was brought to Israel to get treatment and was paraded in front of the cameras, Israelis perceive of their healthcare system as this benevolent force that gives healthcare even to the oppressed. Lia Tarachansky: Once in a while the Israelis bring in a fighter from Syria, and they treat him, and it’s all over the news. “Look how generous we are. The Syrians say that they want to drive us in to the sea, and yet we are bringing their fighters here to give them healthcare.” But those tokens are used in order to create a whole system of obfuscations that denies and makes invisible the very basic thing that once you see it you cannot unsee it, which is that we are in a colonial system. Lia Tarachansky: We are the colonizer. The suffering of millions is within reach of or actions, and that the Palestinians have been fighting for their liberation and freedom since the beginning. And that’s why their fighting us. It’s not a mystery. They’re not anti-Semites. There’s no other thing. They want their freedom. They want the right to live free on their own land. It’s not rocket science, and COVID is a piece of that puzzle, and how we get to a place of equality, that is the question. And I think that with these incredibly stark examples like COVID it becomes unignorable. Israel’s an apartheid system. It’s a version of modern day Jim Crow. Marc Steiner: As we conclude, I mean, the things you both just concluded with are really important, and so I wonder how you think… And since we don’t have all the details of what’s happening in the occupied territories or in Gaza when it comes to COVID. We don’t have all the stats. I’ve been researching it this morning. They’re very difficult to find, but we know that the deaths are way beyond the percentage of most other places on the planet, especially in the Gaza. So how do both of you think, very quickly, this will affect the future? One of the things I said at the end of my opening was that this should be something that forces the American administration to open its eyes again to what’s going on. Whether it will or not is another question. How do you think this horrendous situation among the Palestinians and COVID and the deaths and the infections…. Will it affect any change? How do you see it falling out? Osama, I’ll start with you, and we’ll conclude with Lia. Osama Tanous: Yeah, well, living in that part of the world and witnessing so many wars and so many absurdities in how people die in hundreds and thousands with a clear decision of killing them, right, it also would be naïve to assume that now once people are dying from COVID pandemic, that will bring sympathy and so on, but when Palestinians were being killed by Israeli… Palestinians or Lebanese or any other Arabs were being killed by bombing them with accuracy and with very well knowledge that also they didn’t move anything. Osama Tanous: And we are also as Palestinians tired of being a charity case. We don’t want people to feel bad for us, because we are miserable and suffering and… We’re not poor. We’re not a charity case. We’re under occupation, and that should be a political decision, not a humanitarian decision. Not out of pity for us. So I don’t think that any US administration, in the past or currently, really saw the Palestinians as fully human, as people who are fully human and equal of a decent life. We’re always seen as a threat to the security of Israel, and that’s it, and how that game is played, we can be punished, or we can be given some extra credit. And that whole dialogue, that whole separation between the moderate Arabs, the moderate Palestinians and the extreme Palestinians, right? Osama Tanous: So there’s something very wrong in assuming that someone that occupies you would really want you to be in full health. If he sees you as a human, why would he occupy you. So of course if he does, he sees you as sub-human. And we know that every settler colony, whether it’s the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, saw the indigenous living on the land as simply unworthy of that sovereignty, unworthy of that land, and they’re just an obstacle in order to achieve a larger settler-colonial state. So things should be fought and should be argued differently for an entire process of decolonization equality and not to alleviate suffering. Not from a pity, humanitarian approach, and this is how we should argue through the American public also and through the American politicians. I don’t think that any US administration, in the past or currently, really saw the Palestinians as fully human, as people who are fully human and equal of a decent life. Marc Steiner: Lia? Lia Tarachansky: I think that what scares me the most is that so many people have put so much effort into getting Biden and Harris into office in the US, which is the driving force behind so much of the actions that take place in Israel Palestine, that they’re going to see this win as a win for Israel and Palestine. And Biden and Harris may be a win for you, but they’re certainly not a win for us, because the only thing that Biden and Harris represents is a return to USAID version of occupation, and the complacency of, “Let’s just move things along, so that it looks like the peace process is going on, the peace process is going on.” Lia Tarachansky: And it means nothing when you look at Israel and Palestine as a colonial, and settler-colonial dynamic, specifically. Now, I’m not saying that just because you have to fix the system from its roots by creating real equality, that you shouldn’t do anything, but I’ve seen what happened under Obama Biden, and if that’s what we’re looking for under Biden Harris, that’s going to be a disaster. And the last thing I want to say is if we can find a vaccine for the COVID virus, I don’t see why we can’t fix the colonialism virus. Marc Steiner:That’s very well said, Lia. Thank you for ending it that way. I think it’s important for us to contemplate. Thank you both. Lia Tarachansky, always good to have you with us, and thank you so much. Dr. Osama Tanous, it’s wonderful to meet you, and we look forward to having you back with us again. Enjoy your stay in Atlanta, and thanks so much for both of your participation today. If we can find a vaccine for the COVID virus, I don’t see why we can’t fix the colonialism virus. Osama Tanous: Yeah. Lia Tarachansky: Thank you for having us. Marc Steiner: Thank you both. Thank you both. And I’ve gotten a bunch of emails from folks who really are looking forward to more Palestinian Israeli coverage. We’ll bring you as much as we can, at least from the Marc Steiner show, because it’s a vital issue for me personally, and I think for all of us across the globe, to wrestle with. So again, I’ll thank our guests, Lia Tarachansky and Osama Tanous, for joining us. And you see scrawled across the screen mss@realnews.com. Please write to me. Let me know what you think about this episode, what you’d like us to be covering. Bring your ideas to the table. I’ll do my best to bring them on to the table. So for the Marc Steiner show, here on the Real News Network, I’m Marc Steiner. Take care, and thanks for joining us. From our latest episode of “The Marc Steiner Show,” Palestinian physician, public health scholar, and Al-Shabaka policy analyst Dr. Osama Tanous and award-winning filmmaker and journalist Lia Tarachansky join Marc to discuss COVID-19 and Palestinians’ public health crises under Israeli occupation. Israel has faced international outcry over its refusal to provide Palestinians substantive access to COVID vaccines; however, as our panelists argue, this is merely the latest example of the structural violence of occupation.

      " Content: Marc Steiner: Welcome to the Marc Steiner Show, here on The Real News, and I’m Marc Steiner. It’s good to have you with us. And as you know, on this program I have been covering issues in Palestine and Israel for a long time, and there is no better time than the present to wrestle with what’s going on. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic grips the world in its horrible deadly grasp, it brings into sharp focus the inequities of wealth and power between the developed world and those mired in poverty and lack of power in the developing world. And in few places is it more stunning or geographically close than between Israel, the occupied territories and the besieged Gaza Strip. And that’s what we’re going to focus on today. Marc Steiner: And Israel has one of the finest healthcare systems in the entire planet. Its responses to COVID-19, within Israel itself, has been a beacon to many countries around the world about how to proceed. Yet Palestinians in the occupied territories and in Gaza are facing an epidemic disaster in large part because Israel denied vaccines and assistance to the Palestinian Authority. Saying it’s not their, not Israel’s, responsibility. That they have no responsibility under the Oslo Accords that were done in the early 1990s, and that Gaza is what it is because it’s under siege, blockaded by Israel and Egypt, so it receives little or nothing, even while settlers on the West Bank are being vaccinated in the occupied territories. So it begs a lot of questions which we’re going to try to explore today. COVID has just laid bare, in startling relief, why efforts to end the occupation and force resolution between Palestinians and Israelis should be at the top of the agenda for this new Biden Harris administration. And that’s a much larger conversation, but it needs to be said. Marc Steiner: So we’re joined today by our two guests. Dr. Osama Tanous is a physician, a pediatrician, based in Haifa, now studying and working on his fellowship in Atlanta. He has a master’s degree in public health and is an Al-Shabaka policy analyst and has recently written these two really interesting articles on the COVID crisis that I read. One was for Al-Jazeera, and the other for 972. So welcome for the first time. Good to have you with us. Marc Steiner: And, Lia Tarachansky, a former Real News correspondent in Palestine and Israel who produced many incredible programs for us, is an award-winning film-maker and journalist who grew up in the occupied territories in a settlement and produced films like On the Side of the Road and one of her newer pieces, Ethnocracy: Israel’s African Refugees, among many others. And Lia, welcome back. Good to have you with us. Lia Tarachansky: Thanks, Marc. Marc Steiner: So let me just begin with one of the things you wrote about, Osama, was the question of structural violence and how it plays itself out during this COVID crisis. Could you just begin there for us and talk about what that means? Osama Tanous: Yes. Well, thank you for having me, Mike, and hi, Lia. Marc. Well, I think what’s important for a lot of the audience in the US, or generally in the Western world, that see all the headlines about Israel Palestine but don’t really know all of the historical background that people talk about them as if they are two neighboring countries or two countries that have dispute over borders, and the thing is that is completely not the case.

And the international law that forces the occupation to hold responsibility for the population it occupies in terms of providing them with healthcare, it is meant in order to make occupation not a long-standing issue.

The Palestinians inside of Israel.” But to me the glaring contradiction here is how if you look at the Geneva Accords, Israel is allowing death to take place and this epidemic to surge among Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza. So I mean, help parse this out, both politically and emotionally. Lia Tarachansky: Well, I think if you are going to be looking at international law as a framework in which to understand the actions of Israeli’s [inaudible 00:07:51], you’re going to be very disappointed, because Israel has followed international law only when it suits its own purpose, like so many other countries. And it’s not just to do with Palestinians. For example, the Jewish refugees who survived the Holocaust, and Israel itself, were the driving force behind the 1951 UN convention on the rights of the refugees. And yet, Israel having created now the longest-standing refugee crisis in the world, having African refugees at its doors, has completely ignored that convention, even though it was instrumental in bringing it about. So, I think that the mistake you’re making is looking at it international law and saying, “Hey look, Israel violated it again.” I mean, it’s not really a mistake, but it’s just to going to give you many answers. Lia Tarachansky: I think that what we’re looking at right now is a very sobering reminder that every aspect of care for the masses is a political decision. The Israeli government has been using COVID for its political purposes since the very beginning. Not just vis-a-vis the Palestinians but also vis-a-vis Israelis. In the beginning the response was very good. They shut down the country very quickly. The spread was almost halted completely in its tracks, and then when the criminal prosecutions against the prime minister became frontline news again, suddenly the lockdown is canceled, and COVID is no longer a big deal, and people go out into the streets and spread is astronomical. Right? Lia Tarachansky: So the government has been using COVID cynically for political purposes, like so many other countries. Right now, I’m doing a PhD in Canada, and here we have the vaccine now, and it’s being rolled out in three phases, and the first phase is essential workers, doctors on the frontline, people like that, and the only other exception is indigenous peoples. So Canada made a political, conscious decision to first of all take care of those people who its existence has historically marginalized and oppressed. Israel has done the exact opposite, because Israel is completely ignoring the fact that it’s a flagrant settler-colonial state that is engaged in constant absolute race against apartheid in an attempt to expel and exclude and gerrymander various ways in order to minimize the non-Jewish population of the country. And COVID is just another one of those examples. Lia Tarachansky: I think that it’s gotten so much attention, and I’m very glad it did, is because COVID is now something that all us around the world experience. Every single person in the world has a relationship with the COVID pandemic, and suddenly the experience of not having the vaccine, not because it doesn’t exist, but because, for cynical political reasons, it’s being withheld from you by a powerful state, one of the most powerful armies in the world, a nuclear power, a regional hegemony, economically massive state that’s receiving billions of dollars in aid and in trade. And to have that kind of state withheld a vaccine from a population that’s been battered down for so long and kept on the edge of poverty for so long, for political cynical reasons, I think that’s so stark right now. So unbelievable. So unexplainable that that’s whey you’re seeing so much attention being paid to it. What we’re looking at right now is a very sobering reminder that every aspect of care for the masses is a political decision. The Israeli government has been using COVID for its political purposes since the very beginning.  Marc Steiner: So let’s talk for a moment about what’s really happening here. There was a interesting quote that I found by Omar Shakir from Human Rights Watch. He said that after 50 years of occupation with no end in sight Israel’s duties go beyond offering spare doses. And so the question of what can be done with all this? I mean, everything I’ve read, both in some of the Arab press and in some of the Israeli press, is that COVID is spreading like wildfire in Gaza, though we have no real statistics, and it’s also devastating parts of the West Bank where Palestinians live. And you also on top of that have the new ruling by the International Criminal Court saying Israel can be investigated and brought up on charges because of human rights abuse in the occupied territories, and this could be added to that, if it spreads even more. So the question is where do you both think this goes politically? What happens now? I mean, unless I’m missing it, I’m not seeing a lot of- Lia Tarachansky: Well… Marc Steiner: Go ahead. Lia, go ahead. You were about to say what? Lia Tarachansky: Yeah, about 12 years ago I had the privilege of interviewing the woman who is now the head of the ICC, and 12 years ago I was asking her, “Israel has just bombarded the Gaza Strip in Operation Cast Lead. There’s so much evidence that it violated so many different international laws. When are you going to prosecute Israel? When are you going to prosecute Israel?” And they were on the edge of it back then, 12 yeas ago, and Israel has thrown everything in its power in order to halt and sabotage the process. Lia Tarachansky: Unfortunately, so did the Palestinian Authority, but at the moment now, what we’re seeing is that the lovers of justice have finally succeeded in getting to the point where the ICC has, not just the legal justification to prosecute Israel, but also now the political protection and ability to do so, and I think that that’s a very interesting development. Lia Tarachansky: Unfortunately, Israel is not a signature to the Rome Statute, and so therefore anything that the ICC does do will only apply to the actions of Israeli citizens working in the Palestinian territories. So it would be very, very, very limited, and the high level criminals might get away in exchange for low level war criminals like soldiers on the ground getting their punishment, but I do think that this is a very positive development, because if we do not have accountability, international law is meaningless. Marc Steiner: Did you want to add to that at all, Osama, before I move on? Osama Tanous: Yeah, I think it would be very naïve, this whole assumption that Israel is a normal democratic country that is misbehaving, that commits crimes here and there, and then it can be punished here and there or be taught to correct its behavior and then behave normally with the Palestinians it occupies. This is really too simplistic and naïve, and it completely ignores that Israel, per definition, per excellence, it was defined by excluding Palestinians, by defining who is Israeli by who is not Jewish. And then expelling the vast majority of Palestinians, creating these pockets to concentrate refugees, whether it’s the West Bank and Gaza and then occupy these territories and so on. Osama Tanous: And we shouldn’t aim at thinking how can we provide a better life condition under occupation. How can we make the Gaza Strip or the West Bank… Pump them with money, and pump them with medical care and equipment and NGOs. People have the right to live free everywhere. And also for Palestinians inside Israel, everybody has the right to live free under a country of all its citizens. A secular, democratic state that provides equality for everyone, and that can be achieved only through decolonization of the entire place, from the river to the sea. Osama Tanous: And what seems a very normal thing anywhere. That a country is the state of its citizens, not a state of part of its citizens and of people who are outside of its territory but can become automatically citizens, right? This does not make any sense, so in order to truly make also a better health for everyone and equity and equality in health and in politics, we need to achieve to that kind of solution. And the tools can vary, whether it’s the ICC or other tools, but we shouldn’t aim at creating better life condition under Israeli law. Marc Steiner: So let me stay with you for a moment, Osama. We’ll bring Lia right back in as we conclude. You’re a physician. You practice for the most part in Haifa in Israel, and I’m curious what you have heard from colleagues, from friends, who are working in the occupied territories or the West Bank and in Gaza, about what the situation is and what’s been happening, even with this trickling in of some vaccines are being allowed in. The Israelis are allowing in a modicum of vaccines for some health workers. Russia is supposed to be sending their vaccines in but not enough. So talk about what you know about what the current situation is. Osama Tanous: Yeah, so I mainly work in Haifa, but I’ve had the chance of working also in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip on volunteering with Physicians for Human Rights, so I quite got to know the medical system also in these places, and it’s just a whole mishmash of disorganized network. When there is no social contract between the people and the government, and you don’t know exactly who is in charge of your health, who is giving you health insurance, who is your health provider? So people tend to try to maneuver their way to whatever is possible, whether it’s a governmental hospital, the UNRWA hospital, for profit or try to get permits to go to Israel. So people with anything that happens, you’re always under stress because you want to make the best out of that, and sometimes you’ll have to cross military checkpoint and be politically pressured in order to get a permission. Osama Tanous: And, of course, there is a lot of frustration and anger with the function of the PA, right, because the Palestinian Authority is also a product of the Oslo process. It’s a by-product of the occupation, so it doesn’t truly fulfill its job in ensuring the best medical care for Palestinians. And this is not just about COVID, right, because we have to remember that Palestinians on average live 10 years less than Israelis. They die more of every possible disease, and after COVID is over they will return to die more from a heart attack, from heart diseases, from kidney diseases or any other preventable disease, right? And this is why people are so frustrated, but they don’t know anything else. Osama Tanous: This has been the case for 70 years or more, and these kinds of deaths are not… How can we say it? They are not theatrical. It’s not like bombardment. It’s nothing that you see on the news when people die from bombing. It’s nothing spectacular. So, it’s just an ongoing way of misery, of preventable death, of frustration and anger when the electricity shuts down in Gaza, and then the hospital has to go to a generator, or when there is a military checkpoint so the ambulance cannot pass. If you’re a Palestinian physician, you will also probably try to go abroad and live in a better condition, so it’s an entire system that is engineered to make your life much more harder and much more miserable. Pre-COVID, during COVID and post-COVID, right? And this is what frustrates so many physicians and practicing people in the West Bank and Gaza. Marc Steiner: So, Lia, unless you want to jump in on commentary on that. We’d love to hear what you think, but I’m also curious why there’s so little uproar inside of Israel itself about all of this. Lia Tarachansky: Well, it’s not a mystery. I mean, since COVID has been used so clearly for political purposes in Israel, we’ve seen a very exciting movement, a very powerful protest movement against the government, against Netanyahu specifically. People have been protesting by the masses every day since basically early spring, and that’s very interesting, and that’s very exciting. However, they are completely silent about what’s going on vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and it’s not because they’re heartless colonizers who are sub-human in some way, but it’s because they don’t know. And because the whole system is… while it’s very evident, it’s also incredibly obscured. I grew up in Israel. I grew up in the middle of the West Bank in a settlement, and I had my first conversation with a Palestinian when I came to do university in Canada. So the system is built in a way that constantly segregates in a very conscious way- Marc Steiner: That’s pretty stunning, Lia, what you just said, though. I mean, that’s very stunning, what you just said. I didn’t mean to stop you, because you were on a flow, but that you had not met a Palestinian till you got to Canada. I mean, that just made me stop for a second. I forgot [crosstalk 00:21:39]. Lia Tarachansky: Right. I mean, in the American South during Jim Crow, when you look at segregation during slavery, white people and black people are in the same space, but are they interacting? Do they know about each other’s lives? Do they have any real understanding of what the other lives like? No, because the whites created that system for the benefit of the whites and exclude, through violence and constant oppression, the blacks. It’s the same in Israel. Israel’s an apartheid system. It’s a version of modern day Jim Crow. It’s a very brutal system, and that oppression can only really continue en masse in a country where there’s a draft of people going to the army, if you are constantly obscuring it and justifying it. Lia Tarachansky: So I would say that the Israelis see once in a while the once of a hundred thousand Palestinians whose suffering is brought into an Israeli hospital. Like, for example, a few years ago I was covering the story of Muhammed [Zaza 00:22:38], who was a 15 year old kid in Gaza who was playing with his 12 year old cousin, Ibrahim, and Israel dropped a missile on them, killed Ibrahim, and then the Israeli government brought Muhammed into Israel to treat him. He underwent 20 surgeries. He lost his cousin. Lia Tarachansky: In a later war, Israel accidentally bombed his house. His father had to come to Israel to take care of him in the hospital, and so the family had no income. They fell so far into poverty that it had a whole chain, decade of consequences, but because that one kid was brought to Israel to get treatment and was paraded in front of the cameras, Israelis perceive of their healthcare system as this benevolent force that gives healthcare even to the oppressed. Lia Tarachansky: Once in a while the Israelis bring in a fighter from Syria, and they treat him, and it’s all over the news. “Look how generous we are. The Syrians say that they want to drive us in to the sea, and yet we are bringing their fighters here to give them healthcare.” But those tokens are used in order to create a whole system of obfuscations that denies and makes invisible the very basic thing that once you see it you cannot unsee it, which is that we are in a colonial system. Lia Tarachansky: We are the colonizer. The suffering of millions is within reach of or actions, and that the Palestinians have been fighting for their liberation and freedom since the beginning. And that’s why their fighting us. It’s not a mystery. They’re not anti-Semites. There’s no other thing. They want their freedom. They want the right to live free on their own land. It’s not rocket science, and COVID is a piece of that puzzle, and how we get to a place of equality, that is the question. And I think that with these incredibly stark examples like COVID it becomes unignorable. Israel’s an apartheid system. It’s a version of modern day Jim Crow. Marc Steiner: As we conclude, I mean, the things you both just concluded with are really important, and so I wonder how you think… And since we don’t have all the details of what’s happening in the occupied territories or in Gaza when it comes to COVID. We don’t have all the stats. I’ve been researching it this morning. They’re very difficult to find, but we know that the deaths are way beyond the percentage of most other places on the planet, especially in the Gaza. So how do both of you think, very quickly, this will affect the future? One of the things I said at the end of my opening was that this should be something that forces the American administration to open its eyes again to what’s going on. Whether it will or not is another question. How do you think this horrendous situation among the Palestinians and COVID and the deaths and the infections…. Will it affect any change? How do you see it falling out? Osama, I’ll start with you, and we’ll conclude with Lia. Osama Tanous: Yeah, well, living in that part of the world and witnessing so many wars and so many absurdities in how people die in hundreds and thousands with a clear decision of killing them, right, it also would be naïve to assume that now once people are dying from COVID pandemic, that will bring sympathy and so on, but when Palestinians were being killed by Israeli… Palestinians or Lebanese or any other Arabs were being killed by bombing them with accuracy and with very well knowledge that also they didn’t move anything. Osama Tanous: And we are also as Palestinians tired of being a charity case. We don’t want people to feel bad for us, because we are miserable and suffering and… We’re not poor. We’re not a charity case. We’re under occupation, and that should be a political decision, not a humanitarian decision. Not out of pity for us. So I don’t think that any US administration, in the past or currently, really saw the Palestinians as fully human, as people who are fully human and equal of a decent life. We’re always seen as a threat to the security of Israel, and that’s it, and how that game is played, we can be punished, or we can be given some extra credit. And that whole dialogue, that whole separation between the moderate Arabs, the moderate Palestinians and the extreme Palestinians, right? Osama Tanous: So there’s something very wrong in assuming that someone that occupies you would really want you to be in full health. If he sees you as a human, why would he occupy you. So of course if he does, he sees you as sub-human. And we know that every settler colony, whether it’s the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, saw the indigenous living on the land as simply unworthy of that sovereignty, unworthy of that land, and they’re just an obstacle in order to achieve a larger settler-colonial state. So things should be fought and should be argued differently for an entire process of decolonization equality and not to alleviate suffering. Not from a pity, humanitarian approach, and this is how we should argue through the American public also and through the American politicians. I don’t think that any US administration, in the past or currently, really saw the Palestinians as fully human, as people who are fully human and equal of a decent life. Marc Steiner: Lia? Lia Tarachansky: I think that what scares me the most is that so many people have put so much effort into getting Biden and Harris into office in the US, which is the driving force behind so much of the actions that take place in Israel Palestine, that they’re going to see this win as a win for Israel and Palestine. And Biden and Harris may be a win for you, but they’re certainly not a win for us, because the only thing that Biden and Harris represents is a return to USAID version of occupation, and the complacency of, “Let’s just move things along, so that it looks like the peace process is going on, the peace process is going on.” Lia Tarachansky: And it means nothing when you look at Israel and Palestine as a colonial, and settler-colonial dynamic, specifically. Now, I’m not saying that just because you have to fix the system from its roots by creating real equality, that you shouldn’t do anything, but I’ve seen what happened under Obama Biden, and if that’s what we’re looking for under Biden Harris, that’s going to be a disaster. And the last thing I want to say is if we can find a vaccine for the COVID virus, I don’t see why we can’t fix the colonialism virus. Marc Steiner:That’s very well said, Lia. Thank you for ending it that way. I think it’s important for us to contemplate. Thank you both. Lia Tarachansky, always good to have you with us, and thank you so much. Dr. Osama Tanous, it’s wonderful to meet you, and we look forward to having you back with us again. Enjoy your stay in Atlanta, and thanks so much for both of your participation today. If we can find a vaccine for the COVID virus, I don’t see why we can’t fix the colonialism virus. Osama Tanous: Yeah. Lia Tarachansky: Thank you for having us. Marc Steiner: Thank you both. Thank you both. And I’ve gotten a bunch of emails from folks who really are looking forward to more Palestinian Israeli coverage. We’ll bring you as much as we can, at least from the Marc Steiner show, because it’s a vital issue for me personally, and I think for all of us across the globe, to wrestle with. So again, I’ll thank our guests, Lia Tarachansky and Osama Tanous, for joining us. And you see scrawled across the screen mss@realnews.com. Please write to me. Let me know what you think about this episode, what you’d like us to be covering. Bring your ideas to the table. I’ll do my best to bring them on to the table. So for the Marc Steiner show, here on the Real News Network, I’m Marc Steiner. Take care, and thanks for joining us. From our latest episode of “The Marc Steiner Show,” Palestinian physician, public health scholar, and Al-Shabaka policy analyst Dr. Osama Tanous and award-winning filmmaker and journalist Lia Tarachansky join Marc to discuss COVID-19 and Palestinians’ public health crises under Israeli occupation. Israel has faced international outcry over its refusal to provide Palestinians substantive access to COVID vaccines; however, as our panelists argue, this is merely the latest example of the structural violence of occupation.

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. About 52 years ago, the United States government and Chicago Police committed one of the most egregious acts of extrajudicial punishment by assassinating two Black Panther Party leaders and shooting a number of others. It took a number of years before the case got to trial, and since then, there’s been new revelations. So, we have this opportunity to talk to two of the lawyers that pursued this case and exposed what turned out to be government involvement. And so, joining me today is Flint Taylor and Jeff Haas. Both of them had been working as lawyers in a law team, in a law firm they founded decades ago. Jeff, Flint, thanks for joining me. Jeff Haas: Glad to be here. Thank you. Flint Taylor: Very honored to be with you, Eddie. Eddie Conway: Okay. And likewise, likewise. Jeff, I think I would start off with you, and just lay out the parameters of the original case and trial, if you can, just so that our audience will know exactly what happened at that point. Jeff Haas: Okay. On Dec. 4 of 1969, 14 Chicago police officers assigned to the state’s attorney, Edward Hanrahan, who was the heir to Mayor Daley at that time, came to the Panther apartment, the apartment where Fred Hampton and Akua Njeri and two other people were living, and they raided the apartment. They came in with shotguns, handguns, a carbine, and a 45 caliber machine gun. After the raid, Mark Clark was dead, four Panthers were wounded, and Fred Hampton was executed in his bed. Of course, that’s not the story they told. The original story was that the Panthers had opened fire on the police. So, that’s the way Dec. 4 started, with Hanrahan holding this press conference. Jeff Haas: So, basically, Flint and I spent much of the next 13 years not only proving what happened that day, but also who was behind it. I learned that morning from Deborah Johnson that she said she had been in the bed with Fred Hampton. During a pause in the shooting, they had pulled her out of the room. She saw two policemen go in. These are not in uniform police, plain clothes at that point. Went in, one of them said, “Is he dead yet?” She heard two shots, and then she heard the other one say, “He’s good and dead now.” And so, that’s how I began to learn about what this raid was. It wasn’t a shootout. It was a shoot-in. And I continued to gather stories from the survivors of the raid who said there was a knock on the door and the police came in firing. While I was talking to the survivors and learning their accounts, Flint was actually at the apartment that had not been sealed, so he was gathering the other part of the truth to confront the phony stories that Hanrahan was putting out. Eddie Conway: Okay. And I understand, Flint, I understand y’all went to jail through this process a number of times. Did y’all receive any other … Talk about that for a minute. Other harassments, or what exactly happened with y’all involvement as lawyers in this particular case. Flint Taylor: Well, as Jeff mentioned, my involvement in the case started on Dec. 4, the same as Jeff’s did. I went to the apartment, the police left the apartment open, and went back to crow about what they had done and to falsely claim the Panthers had engaged in a shootout. I spent 10 days there with many others taking evidence and lining up the bullet holes and seeing that there were 90 bullets fired in with machine guns and handguns and rifles and, at most, one fired by Mark Clark, as he was shot through the heart as he was sitting sentry at the door of the apartment. Flint Taylor: During those 10 days, we were definitely afraid of the police coming back. Bobby Rush, who was the Minister of Defense, was not in the apartment, and that was said, “Rush is next.” So, we were staying there in the apartment, we thought the police might come there and raid again. We were taking evidence and hiding it at churches, in their attics, so that in case the police came that we would have secreted and saved the evidence. So, right at the time, there was a great deal of fear in terms of what might happen. Flint Taylor: And as Jeff and I were on trial several years later in the civil trial, we were both held in contempt for protesting the injustices that were going on in the courtroom. And the murderers, cops, were defendants the case, and they came to the trial, and they would be whispering things to Jeff and me and to Fred’s brother, Bill, who came to the trial, and to Doc Satchel, who was one of the survivors of the raid, little whispered threats, as well. I mean, anyone who would murder a man in his bed and shoot up an apartment is certainly, you had to fear that anything might happen with these crazed cops. And so, we were always on our guard throughout the trial and even afterwards. They came in with shotguns, handguns, a carbine, and a 45 caliber machine gun. After the raid, Mark Clark was dead, four Panthers were wounded, and Fred Hampton was executed in his bed. Of course, that’s not the story they told. Eddie Conway: Okay. Jeff, Jeff, tell me, how was the case won, and what did that mean? Jeff Haas: I’m going to make a long story short, because it’s a 13-year legal saga. Eighteen months of those were in the trial court with a very hostile, racist 80-year-old judge from Alabama. Everything we tried to put in, when we accused the police of murder, he dismissed that part of the case, saying that accusation was scurrilous. So, originally, our case was thrown out. Then we fought tooth and nail to get every document that we could. During the course of the trial, two things came out. One, an informant named O’Neal, had been in the Panther Party, and also the discovery of the COINTELPRO program. And we thought, “Is there a connection here?” And another two or three years were spent fighting for documents, and a US attorney turned over to us a floor plan that was in the Do Not File file, but it was Watergate, and he didn’t want to get caught [inaudible 00:07:50]. Jeff Haas: So, in that file was the floor plan of the apartment where Fred Hampton and the others would be staying. And so, when Flint walked in the morning of Dec. 4, he saw the blood on that bed, because when the police came in and had that floor plan, the 90 shots converged on the bed of Fred Hampton. So, we learned more and more that it was the FBI COINTELPRO program that started this, and that actually directed Mitchell, the control agent, to get O’Neal, to get the floor plan. O’Neal gets a bonus. And maybe, to go more into recent stuff, it turns out new documents discovered a year ago … I mean, excuse me, discovered a month ago, show that how much higher ups in the FBI were directly involved in watching what O’Neal and Mitchell were doing and then rewarding them for the raid. Eddie Conway: In fact, I was getting ready to ask Flint, Flint, talk about the discovery of these new documents. Both of you recently wrote an article, and you talk about them a little bit in the article. What does that mean now … I see other had been pursuing this government Information Act since 2015. What’s in these new documents, Flint? Flint Taylor: Well, as Jeff touched on, this battle that we fought for 13 years was a battle to uncover the FBI’s role, and it came out piece by piece, came out with us risking our legal licenses to fight for to get this evidence, because the government was covering it up. And piece by piece, we got that floor plan. We later got evidence that showed that, yes, it was part of a COINTELPRO program from Washington. That document said, was dated, the day before the raid and said that the raid was part of a COINTELPRO program. And then, during the trial, among 200 volumes of documents that were covered up from us was a couple of documents that showed that after the raid, the FBI gave O’Neal a $300 bonus, what we call the 30 pieces of silver that O’Neal got for making the raid, in the FBI’s own words, a success, and that his information was of tremendous value that was not available from any other source. Flint Taylor: So, what we were uncovering at the trial was that, on the one hand, they were congratulating themselves under the secret COINTELPRO program for assassinating Fred and Mark and maiming the others in the apartment, but they were also secreting it from the public and from the courts. And after the trial, and we had connected these dots and gone through 13 years of fighting this case, we knew that Hoover and his lieutenants in Washington, Sullivan, and Moore, were behind this, but we had no documentation. And that’s what came out in the past few months, that here we are 50 years later, and the whole story has not yet been documented. And under the Freedom of Information Act, we got documents that showed that Hoover and Moore, head of the extremist section, and his boss, William Sullivan, who was right next to Hoover, knew about O’Neal, knew about his activities, knew about this guy, Mitchell, who controlled O’Neal, and that they were giving and gave Mitchell a reward in the same way that they gave O’Neal a reward. Flint Taylor: So, what we had been saying and fighting for way back in the 70s and early 80s, these documents confirmed, and that was it wasn’t just a program that was implemented in Chicago under the Chicago FBI, but that, in fact, in Washington, at the highest levels of the FBI, Hoover on down, they were watching, they were rewarding the activities of the FBI, and specifically this informant provocateur, O’Neal, who set up Fred Hampton. Eddie Conway: Okay. Jeff, and I guess my question concerns the statute of limitations. Okay. So, it’s like 50-some years later, and now there’s actual proof of government fingerprints. We’ve always known that. We’ve always said that. Everybody sensed that. The statute of limitations, how is it that the statute of limitations will stop victims of egregious acts, murder and assassination, wounding, et cetera, applied to a case like this when the government sets the statute of limitations, but it’s government agencies that violate the human rights? How is that possible? Jeff Haas: Well, of course, we were in a civil suit. I guess if the perpetrators were still alive, I guess then could be charged with murder or a federal civil rights violation, like some of the people in the Schwerner-Chaney incident. They could be charged criminally. But of course, Hoover was passed away by the time we actually got our appeal decided, and Sullivan and Moore no longer exist. So, I think it would be difficult to sue them in a … Criminally, there’s nobody left to criminally prosecute. I don’t know about a civil case, because we did settle it. I do think there’s some things left undone. These documents that we just got a month ago still contain redactions, which show the FBI is still hiding things. Things that O’Neal reported are blanked out. What we do see is they deliberately told any agent who appeared before a grand jury not to mention the FBI role, and so we don’t know the name of that agent. It’s been redacted today. Jeff Haas: So, I think, and Flint talked to Bobby Rush, who was a congressman and was the head of defense, about releasing the entire FBI file on Fred Hampton. I think at least the public should be allowed to know the truth. I also think Chicago has never … There’s never been an apology by either the federal or local authorities for the murders of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. And I think just like was done in the John Birch cases, there should be a memorial. It should be taught in the schools. And so, there’s still things left undone here. And I think there’s information to be uncovered, and I think there’s some kind of reparations that should be made, at least to the public. And there are still survivors of the raid. Eddie Conway: And I’m a victim myself of COINTELPRO. I spent 44 years in prison, and so this is a personal interest to me. Yes, all the perpetrators, most likely, have passed away, and I understand the two FBI agents that did get charged were pardoned. But this is the government, and I look at Germany and the Jewish question, I look at Kent … It’s the government, those people were acting in the name of the government, as agents of the government, and operating with the auspices of the legality of the government. Why isn’t the government the culprit here and not the individuals that has passed on? I wonder about that. Why isn’t the government … The government did this, why isn’t the government held responsible? And I’m not just talking … Excuse me. I’m not just talking about Fred’s death, I’m talking about Fred Bennett’s death, I’m talking about a number of people where we can see the government’s fingerprints now later in life on those particular cases. Flint Taylor: Well, I think your point is well taken. Of course, the individuals are responsible, whether it be an informant or whether it be the head of the FBI, but they’re working for the government. And in the Hampton case, we had and have a documented case, through the documents of the FBI itself, of a political assassination. And we have a program that lasted for decades and decades called COINTELPRO, which was not only … It wasn’t a surveillance program. It was a disruption and destroy program. It was highly illegal and unconstitutional. And we see the same kinds of activities, perhaps, in different forms happening today. Flint Taylor: So, we have to call the government out as the responsible parties. They are equally, if not more so, responsible for the actions of their higher ups and all the way down to their informants. And I think that we need to raise these issues wherever and whenever we can. And I think we agree with you, Eddie, that it’s a governmental issue, but the government, as you probably know, has a lot of immunity. They protect themselves in the courts and in the law, so you can’t just walk in and say, “Well, the government’s responsible for the assassination of Fred Hampton.” They’ll throw you out of court for that. Flint Taylor: So, it’s a political question that you’re raising. It’s an educational question, I think. It’s a narrative question. It’s in terms of writing people’s history and talking about people’s history and rewriting the lies that are told by the government, whether it be the federal government or whether it be the state’s attorney of Cook County or whether it be the Chicago Police Department and its mayor. All of those aspects fit into the mosaic that you’re talking about, that when you add them all up, the equal sign points to the government. Eddie Conway: Okay. And I’m wondering if … Because you take the New York 21, you can see Gene Roberts, you know that that was part of this particular program. You see the efforts to turn the Blackstone Rangers against the Panthers, you see down in LA, the assassination of Panther leaders by another organization who was also heavily infiltrated with informers, and informants probably actually carried out the assassination. Is this something that can go to Congress? Is this something that the victims and their survivors can seek relief, maybe in Congress or something? I’m curious because I had walked away from it and left it alone, but I’m thinking about it now. And it seems to me that if this is not addressed today, the water protectors … And Jeff, you can talk a little bit about what’s happening with the water protectors and other movements, Black Lives Matter, Black identity extremists, environmental activists, gay rights advocates, et cetera, stands to face this same kind of stuff. You want to talk a little bit about that? Maybe it was a loaded question. Jeff Haas: Well, it’s a loaded question by somebody who’s very educated about what you’re asking about, and of course, you’re right. And although COINTELPRO, the program with that name, ended shortly after it was really uncovered in the 70s, other government programs of not only surveillance, but disruption have continued. And we see this in different forms. I was just noticing in the COINTELPRO, they refer to groups, they’re targets, as Black nationalist hate groups, and I asked, “What is a Black nationalist group?” And they said, “Well, it’s a Black group that has a national headquarters.” So, that was a pretty broad definition. Jeff Haas: Today, their targets, they call them ‘Black identity extremists,’ which is BLM, Black Lives Matter, and any other groups. So, they have these terms that then, I guess, by their terminology, justify targeting them. And we’ve seen these in different forms, a lot of similarities between Ferguson and Standing Rock, where they used in the streets, they used drones, they used surveillance methods, they used tear gas, they used all kinds of concussion grenades, things that are used against the communities. Many of these things are provided by Israel, who’s tested them on Palestinians. Jeff Haas: And we noticed up at Standing Rock, and I was a lawyer up there for quite a while, and we learned later that not only was the pipeline using every single law enforcement, from the National Guard to the Morton County police to … But they also had hired TigerSwan, which was a private security firm from Iraq to do counterintelligence, which meant investigating, it meant infiltrating Water Protectors, and trying to turn them against each other and other groups, and also informing law enforcement. So, you see these techniques developing against movements. Jeff Haas: Just last week, Feb. 3, on the night of Nov. 20, the police opened fire on the bridge, if people remember, at Standing Rock and used water cannons when it was below freezing, but also these [percussion] grenades and tear gas, and did everything they could to attack Water Protectors. And at one point, a woman named Sophia Wilansky was hit by one of these percussion grenades and had half of her arm blown off. Today, when she’s suing, last week, they called the grand jury and they called one of the witnesses there to testify in front of a federal grand jury in an effort to prevent her civil suit from going on, but also to harass one of the water protectors who had been there. So, he had refused to testify, and Steve Martinez has been locked up in the in the Burley County Jail in North Dakota. And that grand jury is sitting for another 17 months, so he could be there for awhile. And this is like a collusion between the defendants, Morton County law enforcement and the FBI, using this to harass one of the witnesses in the case. Eddie Conway: So, I’m sure you’re actively involved in this also, Flint. This is a whole security thing. When I start watching it, it was like BlackRock, Blackwater. Then it turned into … They were being used in Afghanistan, they were being used in Iran. I mean, Iraq. This whole idea of using government security contractors to fight wars overseas, and now to surveil the movement and they use them right here in Baltimore, private planes and everything, what can be done? I mean, now, it’s the government is hiring mercenaries, but the government is no longer responsible for their behavior. What can be done about that, Flint? Flint Taylor: Well, there are avenues that you can, if you can show the connection between law enforcement and the private agencies, you can sue them under the civil rights statutes, but this is criminal activity that you’re talking about. You’re talking about, and Jeff’s talking about, this is criminal activity by these private agencies, and this is not something new. Back in the 60s and 70s, there was collaboration between white supremacist groups and the police and the FBI. And it’s really the same kind of dynamic. And you see it also in terms of private prisons, doing the dirty work of the government in terms of mass incarceration. Flint Taylor: And again, that has to be exposed. The movements are and have to deal with exposing this information because the courts are not always the best place to raise these issue, and they need to be raised. And we’ve had experience in the past, and also forward, in raising it into internationally, raising it at the UN, raising it in the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights. We did that with the police torture cases. But the links have to be exposed. I mean, we look at the Capitol, and now we’re starting to see the links between law enforcement and the white supremacists. And that, again, is nothing new in the sense of we know that the Klan was very much connected with the FBI and the police in the South. We know that the Klan and the Nazis were connected with the police in Greensboro, North Carolina, when the five anti-Klan demonstrators were massacred. And again, Charlottesville. These are the kinds of things that need to be fought against and exposed in any forum that we can raise them in. Eddie Conway: For a final question, and I’m going to go to you, Jeff, but Flint, you can add, what ways can … I mean, exposure, obviously, that information doesn’t necessarily go out on the mass media outlets. What ways can people protect their self and fight back? Jeff Haas: Well, like you said, it was the Intercept that really uncovered some of the details of TigerSwan up in Standing Rock. And also interesting, when they actually uncovered some of these reports, they said, “Well, they’re supporters for the water protectors, they’re going out back to Chicago and Baltimore and other places. I think we need to follow them.” So, in other words, they were trying to justify a private security following people who had been supporting the water protectors up there. So, certainly, publicity is one of the means. Jeff Haas: Actually, the state of North Dakota sued TigerSwan at one point for operating an investigative agency illegally, because they had no license to do that. I wouldn’t rely on the state of North Dakota, which is so dependent on oil and gas and actually suppressed the water protectors as much as they could. But still I think exposure to do that, I think there probably could be laws that when we actually catch them violating the law, they could be sued or they could be criminally prosecuted. So, I think being aware. Jeff Haas: Also, of course, in this surveillance society, social media has become the new tactic. And so, even in our new case in Santa Fe, where Native Americans took down a obelisk that was assembled to the Union soldiers that had fought “the savage Indians,” and that statue had been there. They’re looking for the social media of some of the defendants who are charged with taking down that obelisk. So, I think one of the things is that people be a little careful on social media when they’re at demonstrations and so forth. But I think making people aware, I don’t think people a lot … The whole idea is, as you pointed out, is if you have a private security agency, the idea is to avoid the restrictions that are theoretically on law enforcement. But as Flint said, if they’re serving a “law enforcement purpose,” they can be sued under the Civil Rights Act. Eddie Conway: Flint, you got the final word. Flint Taylor: The final word. I think Jeff covered it quite well. I think that what we have here, we have a new generation of young people and organizations that are fighting back, that are taking through the streets, that are raising these issues. And that’s extremely important, whether it be fighting against police violence, like the Movement for Black Lives, or the young people who are fighting against violence in the schools, and environmental issues, which are so important these days, saving the planet. All of those young folks and all those movements need to be supported. Flint Taylor: On the other hand, or complimenting that, as elders, and the three of us all certainly qualify in that category, we need to lend our experience and our knowledge. Jeff and I as lawyers who have been serving the movement for decades, and you, of course, going through the experiences of COINTELPRO, of a wrongful conviction, of mass incarceration, we all need to do our part as elders in imparting our knowledge and helping to shape and reshape the narratives about what has happened in the past, such as the assassination of Fred Hampton, such as the torture in Chicago by the police commander there, John Birch. And we need to encourage the young folks to listen to us from time to time, because we have a few things that might help them on their road to fighting for the future and for a future. Jeff Haas: Could I [inaudible 00:32:13] a word, Eddie? Not that Flint didn’t cover it beautifully, but just one other additional thing. I think the fact that Black Lives Matter doesn’t have such a hierarchal and patriarchal leadership so that one leader can be targeted or imprisoned or compromised in ways, I think, as they say, “We’re leader-full, not leader-less,” I think that’s also a tactic that makes it harder to destroy a movement than some of the traditional methods. Eddie Conway: Okay. On that note, and I agree with you fully, because that’s really what destroyed most of the movements, was the attack at the top and the second echelon. Thank you, Jeff and Flint, for joining me. Jeff Haas: It was my pleasure, Eddie, to see you, and you’re really a symbol of resistance for all of us. Flint Taylor: Amen to that. Eddie Conway: Okay. Thank you. And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. Flint Taylor and Jeff Haas, co-founders of the People’s Law Office in Chicago, were the lead lawyers in the landmark case that exposed the FBI’s involvement in the assassination of Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. While that case was settled nearly 40 years ago, newly revealed documents show that the conspiracy to murder Hampton and cover up evidence of government involvement goes deeper than most ever imagined. In this special episode of “Rattling the Bars,” Eddie Conway talks with Taylor and Haas about their decades-long battle for the truth, the government’s continued surveillance and persecution of dissenters, and the ongoing fight for justice and accountability. \n",

      " Content: Jaisal Noor: Welcome to the Real News, I’m Jaisal Noor. Democrats won the White House and control Congress, defeated the entrenched power of the GOP, and even survived what’s been described as an attempted coup. Now the only thing that stands between the Democrats and their campaign promises is the Democratic party itself. While Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion emergency relief can pass the Senate with a simple majority, Democrats are still somehow conflicted on whether they want to end the filibuster, which Republicans could use to block other legislation by requiring 60 votes. If Democrats fail to end or circumvent the filibuster, a Jim Crow relic that was used to block the Civil Rights legislation, they will likely fail to deliver additionally badly needed stimulus, cancel student debt, reform the Supreme Court, expand voting rights that Republicans are so determined to undermine, or establish statehood for DC, while progressive groups are targeting centrist Democrats who seemingly don’t want their party to win, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema. Jaisal Noor: We’re now joined by Corbin Trent, a former staffer for AOC. He worked on Sanders’ 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, a co-founder of Justice Democrats and No Excuses PAC, which is putting pressure on conservative Democrats to demand they allow their party to win, to pass legislation that will improve the lives of people across the country. Thanks so much for joining us. Corbin Trent: Thanks for having me Jaisal. Thanks for having me. Jaisal Noor: So the country has been watching these impeachment hearings unfold. A majority of Senate Republicans appeared to reject prosecution’s arguments, including harrowing new footage showing senators and staffers narrowly avoiding being attacked during the January 6th attacks, indicating they will likely vote to acquit former President Trump of incitement. So with this in mind, with the last several years of how the Republicans have operated, how Mitch McConnell have operated in the Senate, how should the Democrats respond? Should they respond by nuking the filibuster so they can campaign follow through on some of their campaign promises? Corbin Trent: Yeah, I think absolutely they should. And the other thing they’ve got to remember, I think, is how we’ve won before, right? As a party, and the fact that it wasn’t that long ago that we had some pretty good majorities in the Senate and the House. And I think the way we do that is by improving the lives of people in the country. And because of the way the system operates, the only way we’re going to be able to do that in the near term is by eliminating the filibuster. I mean, it’s not even like we’ve got this filibuster in place, like the relic that it is, where you see senators standing on the floor doing multi-day speeches to block legislation. This has literally just become a procedural thing that’s as easy as using your debit card. I mean, it’s like you got to have 60 votes to pass anything significant because of the threat of this procedural filibuster. And I think it’s bizarre that we’ve let something so arcane and so pointless just hold this country up and tie our hands and make us unable to act. Jaisal Noor: So Democrats are now in a position of saying, and I’m talking about Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema specifically, they want to preserve norms and leave norms intact. At the same time, Republicans are saying that we will allow attacks on the transfer of power. It’s just, please help us understand why this makes sense. Corbin Trent: I think one of the things that we’ve got to remember is that most of the folks in the House and the Senate, their number one priority is preserving their own political life, right? Their own political career, their own political future. And I think one of the things that you can see when you’re watching the way this trial is going to unfold, this impeachment trial, is it almost doesn’t matter what the evidence is. What I’m hearing from the media, generally, is that this is a foregone conclusion. That actual phrase: foregone conclusion, to what the results are going to be. Republicans are going to vote to acquit Donald Trump, regardless of the evidence that’s presented. And that’s where we’re at as a country. That’s where the Republicans are as a party. Corbin Trent: But I think it’s emblematic and it’s a direct result of the narrow focus of most of our politicians, which is how do I protect my political career? They’re not really interested in protecting Donald Trump. I don’t think there’s all that much affinity for Donald Trump in the Republican party in the Senate. I think in fact, there’s disdain and disgust for the guy. I think it’s a different disdain and disgust than a normal person would have. They just feel like, I think, that maybe they’re above him or he’s beneath them or whatever. And some of them were probably offended about his rhetoric and the actions of the 6th and before. But what they’re afraid of is, if they stand up, then their voters in the primaries will fire them. That’s what they’re afraid of. They’re not protecting Donald Trump. So I think what we’ve got to be able to do is convince these electeds that inaction and allowing this sort of status quo to continue and our inability to function as a nation is also going to endanger their jobs. If it makes them afraid for their jobs, then they’ll, I think, take action. Jaisal Noor: So I want to talk about tactics. You and No Excuses PAC are raising money to run ads against these centrist Democrats. And you’ve said you’re working to potentially recruit primary challengers when they’re up for reelection, I believe in 2024. So some people say, look, that’s crazy. Corbin Trent: Nate Silver, for example, says that’s crazy. Jaisal Noor: Yeah, Nate Silver. Corbin Trent: CNN op-ed recently said that’s crazy. Yes there’s- Jaisal Noor: So we’re talking about, for example, in West Virginia, in the recent election, 2020, the Republican won by something like 60 points against a progressive Democrat. How do you respond to those critics? Corbin Trent: The way I respond to those critics is that doing what we’re doing now and what we’ve been doing for the last decade as a party is what I think is the crazy thing. So if you go back just a few cycles, right? I’m not talking about going back to the 1930s, 40s and 50s, when Democrats ruled the roost in Washington DC, I’m talking about going back to 2014, 2012, 2010, right? And looking at the majorities. When President Barack Obama was elected, Democrats in the Senate had a 60 vote majority, right? And they kept somewhere around 58, 59 vote majority for the first part of his term. And then they lost it. And then they lost again in 2014. And then they continually got their asses handed to them electorally because they weren’t delivering for the American people. Corbin Trent: Then, like now, we were in crisis. That was the housing crisis. And there was an economic crisis that was plaguing Americans and their government was plagued with inaction. They didn’t do enough to help the American people recover from that. And the consequence was the Democratic Party got thrown out of the Senate and then the House and then the White House. And I think it’d be foolhardy to continue that same kind of, head in the sand, let’s just toe this middle of the road approach, we don’t need to go big, slow your roll, kind of attitude. I think that’s what leads to Democrats getting decimated. Corbin Trent: And as far as Joe Manchin specifically goes, in 2012, he won his election by about 25 points. The last time he was up for election in 2018, he won that election by 3%. That’s a 22% dip. My guess is the next time he runs, first of all, he’ll be 77 years old the next time he runs. He’s not certain that he’s going to run. He’s famously said, well, he doesn’t know if he’s going to run again. My guess is he’s going to lose regardless, whether he runs or doesn’t run. And to not start now recruiting Democrats that can win in West Virginia, to not start now building a party that can actually have a brand strong enough in West Virginia to win, that to me is the crazy thing. Corbin Trent: And Democrats right now have a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate and the White House. And their actions, as a party and as a government, are going to determine whether or not Democrats win in the next elections. Right now, voters have given us the keys to the government. And what we’ve got to prove over the next two years is that we’re worthy of those keys and they don’t need to take them away. In fact, they need to give us bigger majorities so that we can do more as a government, as a party. But that’s not that’s not where I think Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin are taking this. That’s not what they wanted to do. Corbin Trent: Hopefully now, we have seen, the ads are starting to have an impact in my opinion. We’re seeing Joe Manchin back off a little bit. Something specific, like the $2,000 checks, he was against it. Ads ran. He’s backed off. He’s for it. He was talking about the size of the stimulus package. Now he’s basically accepted that and moved on. Even the $15 minimum wage being attached to the House version, he appears to be accepting and not pushing back on. So yeah, you could say that trying to recruit a primary opponent to Joe Manchin is a bad move. He’s going to leave the party, or nobody else can win, or… There’s all kinds of criticisms of it, but I think sitting in waiting to continue losing House and Senate seats over the next few cycles, I think that’s way crazier. Jaisal Noor: Another thing, which I personally feel is crazy is that after seeing Republicans use all their power to stack the, for example, stack federal courts across the country, to gerrymander in States across the country, why Democrats aren’t now using this power to structurally change how the government is set up. We know, for example, fundamentally, the Senate is undemocratic. Washington DC doesn’t have representation. Adding two senators to Washington DC would change the political landscape in Washington. It seems like common sense thing. Voting rights, which they’ve already introduced as part of HR1 expanding voting rights, protecting that, is something that’s never going to get 60 votes in the Senate. Talk about, we’re going to play a couple of your ads. Talk about the messaging around these ads and why you think they’re effective. Corbin Trent: Yeah. So with the first Manchin ad that we put out, what we were trying to really make sure that voters in West Virginia understood is that Senator Manchin was taking a political position. I think very often you see politicians in Washington agreeing. You rarely see President Trump and the Democrats standing together, united on policy. But sending $2,000 relief checks to the American people was one of those rare times. Unfortunately, our Senator Joe Manchin, thinks he knows better than both our President and the Democrats in Congress. I guess Joe just don’t know what it’s been like to live through the pandemic. He was out on a political island and it was clear that the reason for that was to try to take some political power for himself, right? Corbin Trent: The thing that he was blocking, which at this point was $2,000 checks, was supported by Donald Trump. It was supported by Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders, Warnock, Ossoff, everybody was basically behind this thing, but he wanted to sort of stand in the way. And obviously his state and the people in that state desperately needed that help. And that’s what we wanted to make sure that people understood with that ad is that your senator is out there blocking this thing that’s going to help the state for no reason other than his own political gain. And that he’s basically standing alone. That was the idea there, what we really wanted to articulate. Corbin Trent: And then when it comes to Senator Sinema, she’s okay with the gridlock because it protects her. She thinks the filibuster should stay right where it is. She thinks your checks are getting out fast enough, that the tests are happening rapidly enough, and that everything is okay. Countless hours of partisan bickering and back and forth, they don’t prevent one case of COVID. They don’t stop one death. They don’t create one job. It’s time Kyrsten Sinema stood up for the people and stood against the filibuster. The real focus there is around filibuster and this sort of commitment to inaction and commitment to debate, as opposed to doing and creating results of American people, and her sort of desire to stand up strong, stand up very strong to protect her colleagues in the Senate, stand up very strong to prevent to protect these sort of institutional blockades to action. Corbin Trent: And I think the other thing is to highlight the fact that these folks are saying what the Senate needs to do is have more debate and less action. And I think that there’s very few people among the electorate that would think that’s the case. And the one of the things that you hear a lot about is this sort of unintended consequences, right? What happens when you get rid of the filibuster? Then the Republicans are back in charge, then what? Well, like you were just saying, we already know what the Republicans do when they’re in charge. They don’t even have to have a a filibuster proof majority to shove justices through, to push things through. They use all the mechanisms they have at their disposal, and some that are sort of on the verge of their disposal, to push their agenda through, which ironically is a very unpopular agenda when it comes to most people’s political opinion in the country. But they’re willing to utilize their power to push it through because that’s that’s who they are as a party. And the thing is is that if we can get in there and push and actually push through some of the Democratic agenda, the good thing is A, it’s popular and B, it can improve lives. And it can be something that is directly and nearly immediately impacting the lives of the people that have elected them. Jaisal Noor: All right. Corbin Trent, thanks so much for joining us and discussing these important stories, which will continue to be something we follow over the next couple of years. Thanks so much. Corbin Trent: Thanks for having me. Jaisal Noor: And thank you for joining us at the Real News Network. From eliminating the filibuster to pushing through much-needed $2k COVID-19 relief checks, conservative and centrist Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are standing in the way of crucial legislative actions that would allow the party to make good on its campaign promises. Fearing this will result in electoral backlash, progressive groups like No Excuses PAC are working to hold Democrats’ feet to the fire, including running ads and recruiting primary challengers to pressure Sens. Manchin and Sinema. No Excuses PAC co-founder (and former AOC and Bernie Sanders staffer) Corbin Trent joins Jaisal Noor to talk about how supporting the status quo may cost Democrats the next election. \n",

      " Content: Taya Graham: Hello, my name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. Remember, this show has a single purpose, holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable, but we don’t do this just by parsing the behavior of individual cops. No. We delve deeper into the system that makes bad policing possible. And today, we’re going to achieve this goal by telling the story of how police in a small Pennsylvania town tried to criminalize a treatment for opioid addiction, even as the suffering from the widespread over prescription of the pain killers has engulfed the country in an existential crisis. But, before we get started, I want you watching to know that if you have evidence of police misconduct, we might be able to investigate for you. Please direct message me @tayasbaltimore on Twitter or Facebook, or you can email us at parattherealnews.com. And please like, share and comment on our videos, you know I read your comments and that I appreciate them. Okay. That’s out of the way. Now, as we often point out on this show, policing isn’t just about law enforcement. It’s also a business. In fact, we have used a variety of different sets of data and personal stories to point out just how embedded the profit motive is in the process of American policing. The point is, you don’t have to dig too deep into the process of American law enforcement to find the cruelty of crony capitalism running through it. And the reason we keep making this point is simple, policing for profit wreaks havoc in the lives of the people it touches. It’s a corrupting influence that turns law enforcement into a tool for inequality and greed that we continue to investigate. That’s why today we’re going to tell the story of Dawn Williams, a woman whose arrest and subsequent harassment by law enforcement touches all the aforementioned ills of a destructive war on drugs and police who seem eager to use it to book stats and generate revenues. Her story starts in the small sleepy town of Scottsdale, Pennsylvania. Dawn had just left the bedside of her father who was on life support in a nearby hospital. There, she was facing a horrible decision of if and when to discontinue his care. But as she was driving home, she made a turn without signaling, and before she could drive another block, the police pounced. Let’s listen. Dawn Williams: I was going through a lot. My dad had just recently fell ill and was in the hospital, and an hour prior to the DUI, his organs were failing, he was dying, and I had gotten the call from the hospital telling me that. And so I was crying, obviously an hour prior to this pull over, and so when he came up to the car, he instantly assumed that my appearance meant that I was on drugs, just because my eyes were red. And so he pulled me out of the car, and he asked me multiple times if I was using drugs, and I told him no. And then after, he did this whole ordeal where he had me do the different tests that [inaudible 00:03:08] and all of that. And I believe I’ve passed it. He says I didn’t, except for one. And then finally he said, “Are you on any prescription medications?” And I said, “Well, yeah, I’m prescribed buprenorphine.” The instant that I said that, he said, “Well, you’re under arrest for driving on prescription medication.” Taya Graham: And so, despite the fact she had a prescription for the drug buprenorphine, an approved treatment for opioid addiction, and even though she explained to the officer, her eyes were puffy from tears of despair, he arrested her. Let’s listen to what happened next. Dawn Williams: All that was in my system was the buprenorphine, and I wanted to prove that because I had already admitted to it, and that I wasn’t impaired. And so they took me to get the blood and everything, and then once they did that, they finally released me. Taya Graham: Now, her arrest was not the end of the story. In fact, the saga dragged on for three more years. But before we delve deeper into what happened to Dawn, I want to give you, the viewer, some background on buprenorphine and why it is such a critical tool in the battle against opioid addiction, and why it is so disturbing that police would arrest her for taking it. And to do so, I’m joined by my reporting partner, Steven Janis. Steven, thank you so much for joining me. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Taya Graham: So tell us a little bit about the history of buprenorphine. Stephen Janis: Well, buprenorphine was a drug that was developed about 20 years ago for the treatment of opiate addiction as an alternative to methadone. It can be prescribed by a doctor rather than having to go to a clinic, so it’s been considered to be a breakthrough for people who are suffering from opiate addiction. And also it doesn’t get you high, and it doesn’t have some of the after effects that methadone has. So really, it’s been really a breakthrough treatment. The only problem is the bureaucracy has made it difficult for doctors to be able to prescribe it. So really, it’s been a win-win except for the fact that the government keeps intervening in ways that are not productive. Taya Graham: Now, despite the fact that buprenorphine has been proved very effective, the DEA actually tried to make it harder to obtain. Tell us about that. Stephen Janis: Yeah. I mean, buprenorphine is currently schedule three, which is part of a schedule that goes from one to five, that sort of tells you how dangerous a drug is. One being absolutely no medical use, and the DEA tried to move it up that schedule, make it more dangerous, more difficult to obtain, and more difficult to prescribe. So it was really counter productive, given that we have this opioid crisis in the country, it was really absurd. Taya Graham: Now, you have reviewed the arrest records of Dawn and reached out to the police department. What have you learned? Stephen Janis: Well, it’s amazing if you look at the statement of probable cause that Dawn shared with us, how much the cop tries to get her, makes her go through multiple field sobriety tests, and doesn’t listen to her information when she tells him that she’s on a legally prescribed medication. It really seems, from reading the documents, that they were out to get her. And on top of that, when I tried to call the police department, of course, I didn’t get any answer. So right at this moment, they’re not commenting, but it’s clear from the documents itself that they really, really wanted to make this arrest, and it’s not clear as to why. Taya Graham: So, we have a legally prescribed, proven effective treatment for opioid addiction. Then, we have a woman who has been given this medication to assist her during a fragile recovery. And then we have a cop who apparently seems set on criminalizing her for reasons that remain unexplained. But unfortunately, the arrest is not where the story ends. And for more on that, I’m talking to Dawn herself. Dawn, thank you for joining us. Dawn Williams: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: So, after you were arrested, tell us what happened next. Dawn Williams: Once he placed me in cuffs, he put me in the back of the car. When he put me in the back of the car, he did a search on my vehicle. He found nothing. And then my fiancé came to the car because I had my daughter with me. My fiancé came, he picked up the car, he picked up my daughter, and at that time he even spoke to him, he was like, “I sent her, I was home when she left. I would never have sent her with my daughter somewhere if she were impaired.” He even witnessed the cop saying that, “It doesn’t matter if you’re impaired or not, she’s not allowed to do this.” And so then they took me to the hospital to have blood drawn, which I completely agreed to, because like I said, all that was in my system was the buprenorphine and I wanted to prove that because I had already admitted to it, and that I wasn’t impaired. And so they took me to get the blood and everything. And then once they did that, they finally released me. Taya Graham: Dawn, why do you think they pursued this case? Why would they continue to charge you even after they learned you had told the truth? Dawn Williams: The only thing that makes sense to me is why they did it, is money. They need to bring in money. It’s a huge thing, that the town that this happened to me in is a small town, there’s not a whole lot of crime, your average, basic small town. So I think that they were just out hunting. I mean, whenever I initially first seen the police and I was dropping the girl off, they were just sitting in their car, parked. And so I think that they thought it was an opportunity to bring in some revenue. Taya Graham: So how many doctors did they enlist to try to charge you with a crime? Dawn Williams: I’m not exactly sure of an exact number of doctors. Where I get that information from is when they finally decided, three years later, three and a half years later, to drop this, what the DA had said to the judge was that the Commonwealth could not prove their burden, and then he gave some reasons why. And one of them was that they had reached out to multiple different doctors to try and get one of them to say that this medication definitely would have impaired her, in the amount of medication, et cetera, et cetera. So I’m not exactly sure how many, but I know it was quite a few and I know they contacted, like I said, the initial lab that they took me to was obviously of their choice, but then that wasn’t even good enough. They still sent the blood work out, again, to at least another one, or I think he said other labs, we sent it to other labs, and said that they tried to get it to just say something different, but it all came up the same. Taya Graham: So prosecutors refused to drop this case. Tell us about what happened. Dawn Williams: So initially when they charged me, they charged me with, I have no background, I have no criminal record. So initially they charged me with a regular first offense DUI. So that means that I would have something called an ARD, that I should have been able to use, if in fact that, like I wasn’t willing to go to trial, if I wasn’t willing to chance being convicted. If I wanted to just, get a lesser sentence, have it expunged in the end, and all of those benefits of taking a deal. I was given that initially. But then, I don’t know who found out, or who realized, it wasn’t found out, it was always in the police report that my daughter was with me, but they offered me my ARD. I accepted. I was scared. Like I said, at the time they keep kept pounding into my head that DUIs, you can’t beat them. If a cop says you were DUI, I don’t know the percentage, but you’re basically going to be charged. And so that really scared me that I would have this record lingering over me, so I was going to take it. But somebody was greedy, and all of a sudden said, “No, she had her daughter with her, that bumps it up from a regular misdemeanor to an M1,” which is a misdemeanor first, I don’t know, it bumps it up to kind of like as if it was my second or third time getting a DUI, opposed to my first DUI. And that made the penalties a lot worse as well. So, I reached out to Dr. Fisher and let him know what was going on, and by the grace of God, he was outraged. So he was willing to come and testify for me any time that I needed, free of charge. He was willing to have me tested out of his pocket, neurologically, physically, mentally, anything that they needed to prove that this medication is not what they think it is. And that’s really the only way I beat this charge, was because I had him in my corner. Dawn, how has this affected you personally? I’m assuming that if you were being treated for addiction, this must’ve been very difficult, and this case dragged on for three years. Can you tell us what kind of toll this has taken on you and your family? This must’ve been an emotional and financial burden as well. Dawn Williams: About six months after the incident, I, for no connection to this, I moved to North Carolina. And they still had me come back for [inaudible 00:12:13] regularly, which cost a lot of money to travel from North Carolina back to Pennsylvania, it’s about a 10 hour drive. I went through the steps of getting on this medication and to recover from addiction, and had been on this medication for about two years at this point. So I had been on it for quite some time and it helped me tremendously. It’s how people get their lives back. Whenever somebody is addicted and they go through withdrawal, and I’m not trying to make excuses for it because it can be done, but when you have children, you have to just go through that, stop work, stop taking care of your kids. That’s not easy. It’s a medication that they themselves prescribed. I mean, during this case, they tried to have me go have what they call a PRN, which is a [inaudible 00:13:09] evaluation at a drug and alcohol behavioral help center. If I wasn’t already on buprenorphine, they would recommend me getting on buprenorphine. So it’s just ironic that they want to pull you over for something that they themselves, and charge you on, for something that they themselves recommend. Taya Graham: As you know, the mainstream media often highlights cases of police brutality as exceptional examples of so-called bad apple cops. They like to use shocking footage and brutal arrests as proof that they are adroitly putting the spotlight on American law enforcement when extreme behavior warrants it. Fair enough. But the problem with this type of reporting is that it misses the forest for the trees. What I mean is it ignores how the system slowly grinds up people like Dawn with little or no oversight, how the law enforcement industrial complex finds new ways to feed off the public trough by dragging people into a system who clearly don’t belong there, and how it achieves that goal by insinuating itself into facets of civil life where it seems ill suited to operate, but intervenes nonetheless. And let me add, on a personal note, getting buprenorphine as treatment for opioid addiction can be the beginning of saving your life. Most of you watching have a loved one, a family member or a friend, who have had their lives damaged by addiction. Can you imagine them being persecuted and prosecuted for doing the right thing and getting a doctor’s treatment? To make this clear, I want you to take a close look at one of the documents Dawn shared with us. It’s the medical bill for the so-called drug test which police conducted in order to justify the charges against her. The total for this, for lack of a better term, test, was $450. But I want you to think about that for a second, and consider the implications, because that 450 is a symbol of a deeper malaise that has been the focus of this show. First of all, there’s a special $200 buprenorphine charge. We called the County Medical Examiner’s Office and tried to determine what that was, but best we can guess, it’s a special charge just to test for buprenorphine. And if that’s not odd enough, then we have another so-called administrative fee. That’s another 50 bucks. I guess he might be saying at this point, so cops wasted a couple hundred bucks on a test, so what? I mean in the grander scheme of an industry that spends $80 billion a year on incarceration, what’s a couple hundred bucks among friends? Well, it’s what that money represents, not the dollar amount, that’s more important. Notice how the County Medical Examiner was able to use a bad arrest to rack up a nice piece of cash on a meaningless case of trumped up charges. Maybe this isn’t the first time they’ve had to test for buprenorphine. Maybe this is a nice little gift from the cops to keep bringing in revenue to keep the lights on. Maybe it’s just one of hundreds of tests a month, a nice little police-generated cash cow. We asked the County to break out the numbers for us, and surprise, they haven’t responded. And maybe they’re not the only agency with their hand in the cookie jar. Let’s remember that the prosecutors put Dawn through a three year ordeal, ordering her to submit to a mental evaluation. I wonder who gets paid for that? And let’s not forget her useless public defender who was billing taxpayers while he continued to drag out the case. And we can’t fail to mention the prosecutors that went on a doctor shopping spree, again, courtesy of you, the people who pay their salaries. The worst part of this whole story is that no one was watching. If Dawn had not reached out to our show, this whole fiasco would happen under the shield of secrecy usually afforded to police. The law enforcement heroes who trumped up charges and racked up expenses on your tab would have been able to keep withdrawing from the bank of public safety, unbeknownst to the people who fund it. Well, sorry to inform the Scottsdale Police Department, but that’s what we do here at the Police Accountability Report. We turn over the rocks and we see what crawls out, even if it’s just a questionable invoice for 450 bucks, we find out the truth, uncomfortable or not. Granted, we’re just journalists, and our job is to report the facts, nothing more, but at least in this case, the public that you purport to serve will get a fair assessment of your services. The people who pay your salaries will have the opportunity to judge if a three year taxpayer financed prosecution is worth the price. For this so-called pursuit of justice will not be served under the cover of darkness, that’s because we just turned on the lights. I’d like to thank Dawn Williams for being so forthright with us and coming forward to speak with us. Thank you, Dawn. Dawn Williams: Thank you for having me. Taya Graham: And I have to thank Intrepid reporter Steven Janis for his writing, editing and reporting on this piece. Thank you, Steven. Stephen Janis: Taya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

My name is Taya Graham, and I am your host of the Police Accountability Report. Please, be safe out there. While the nation suffers a opioid addiction crisis fueled by profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, police in a small Pennsylvania town arrested a woman for taking a widely prescribed treatment for opiate addiction while driving. In this week’s PAR, Stephen Janis and Taya Graham examine the case of Dawn Williams. We explore what this case reveals about the ongoing war on drugs and how law enforcement continues to criminalize facets of civic life, raising troubling questions about the true imperative of American policing.

      " Content: Marc Steiner: Hello, I’m Marc Steiner. And welcome to the Marc Steiner Show right here on The Real News Network. Good to have you all with us. Well, last week we saw Wall Street in a tizzy because a group of Redditors on Wall Street Bets forum worked in tandem to use stock trading apps like Robinhood to collectively invest in stock for video game retailer GameStop, driving that stock price way up in a matter of hours and causing giant losses for many wealthy investors and hedge funds that were trying to short sell that stock.  Now, other wealthy investors made a killing. The financial world began to reel at the hands of these online renegades, or are they really renegades? And it wasn’t just GameStop. Other businesses that are heavily targeted for short selling are places like AMC entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and they all got swept up in this Reddit led charge. Then the fun became to an abrupt end when Robinhood and other platforms imposed strict restrictions on traders, effectively stopping their ability to buy shares in GameStop and other select stocks. Now, this move has prompted outcries and accusations of game rigging by people across the political spectrum. And just imagine now, I’m talking about Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the Congresswoman and Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Elizabeth Warren. And on Friday, Warren said, her quote was, “For years, the stock market has been less and less about the value of business and more and more like casino gambling. GameStop is just the latest and most visible example. We need to take this not as a one-off problem, but as a systemic problem that requires systemic regulation and enforcement.” And so there’s a lot going on here, and what has unfolded has huge implications. We know that viewers like us here at The Real News have a lot of questions about what is really going on here, exactly what happened on Wall Street and how that affects us, why it’s important and what it means for us all going forward. What’s it mean for our retirements? Well, let’s start here, Bill Black is back. Good to have you back, Bill.  Bill Black: Thank you.  Marc Steiner: Bill’s an associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas city, he’s a white color criminologist, former financial regulator and author of the book The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One. Also, joining us again is Arun Gupta. Arun’s back with us. Arun, welcome back.  Arun Gupta: Great to be with you.  Marc Steiner: He is a noted journalist who has written for the Washington Post, The Nation, Raw Story, Guardian, Jacobin, many other places. He’s a graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York, and working on his book, which is called Bacon as a Weapon of Mass Destruction, a Junk Food Loving Chef’s Inquiry Into Taste, which might be very fitting for today’s discussion. So good to have you both here. Can we just start with this? Can we just start … and, Bill, I’ll jump to you first if you don’t mind. Just a very, very short, a quick lesson in what these terms mean, like short sale. I think people have a hard time grasping what kind of game is being played. Bill Black: Okay. So the very idea that short sale is a game is itself problematic, right? You’re betting one direction. You’re always betting. Why betting one direction is considered a game and the other direction is not considered a game is quite unclear. And bizarrely, not necessarily these short sellers, but the short sellers tend to be often the people closest aligned with the public interest, as opposed to the folks who are going long, which is of course the opposite.  So first really basic point that picks up on your basic point, this is all just the secondary market. This is not the primary market. The primary market is the initial public offerings. The IPO’s. That’s what actually gets capital to accompany that it could invest, right? That’s the whole theory why we’re doing this thing. So we have this elaborate, massive secondary market. Why? Because when markets are broad, deep is another phrase for them, it means whole lot of trades. They tend to be more efficient. Or if you want to phrase it the other way, less inefficient, harder to scam and such, right?  To make this seamless market where you can just go in on, today your app and actually buy a stock and such, we have behind the scenes market makers, which is one of the reasons when we have a great financial crisis, things go to hell in seconds, right? Soon nanoseconds, because the market makers fail. There’s not somebody always on the other side of a trade magically at the price, even in the ballpark of the price you’re trying to buy or sell. So these market makers come in, and if price is falling precipitously, they go bankrupt. In which case, then trading ceases. When trading ceases, what’s the value of an asset if you can’t sell it? So having deep markets, having a efficient markets is actually a good thing for the world. And that’s the theory, the whole idea of the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission is an information regime. We give you more reliable information and that means you can make these decisions. And this got coupled with, to your point, this has nothing frigging to do with the economy, the real economy. We can’t emphasize that enough. The real economy is one thing and the whole financial system is another thing. To call it a casino is like to be shocked in Casa Blanca [crosstalk 00:06:19] that’s why it frigging exists in large part. Okay? One of the ways you can bet, and the reason it can be on the side of the quasi-angels, is a company is highly overvalued in its stock price. Why? Well, often because the CEO is looting the place and cheating and engaging in accounting fraud, right? Charles Keating was famously a beset by shorts, right? Because people figured out that he was scamming things. The great financial crisis, we have all seen the movie now, The Big Short, right? You have unbelievable overstatement in the real economy of asset values. Well, how do you bet against it? You bet that the price is going to fall. You enter into borrowing transaction, and you pledge that you’re going to buy shares or delivered shares that you don’t have. And that’s great if the price falls, but if it doesn’t, then it’s a world of hurt, but there’s something worse, and that is called a short squeeze. And a short squeeze is famous. Cornelius Vanderbilt did this to another robber Barron, Drew. Drew did a whole shorting in league with corrupt politicians and they targeted Vanderbilt. What was he thinking? And Vanderbilt got his own corrupt politicians and did a short squeeze. And what that means is, back to this broad markets versus very thin markets. These markets get super thin when it comes to lots and lots of trading. So the shorts have to bid back to get the stock, but the stock skyrocketing in value and they bet it was going to fall from roughly 32 to somewhere in the twenties. And now it’s in the three hundreds and four hundreds at times. That’s when they completely go bankrupt, literally. And in this case it was a hedge fund or a couple of hedge funds that specialized in shorting. And when people got together and said, “Screw fundamental values, let’s all buy GameStop,” Then it rose in price. And the entity, the hedge fund shorting couldn’t deliver the shares and actually got bailed out in the first instance. Then as you say, there’s a dispute. Did Robinhood voluntarily stop in league with others, or did it really come up against its capital limits? Because capital limits actually do exist, and it wouldn’t be illogical that they came up against the capital limits, but without knowing more [inaudible 00:09:33] we may have to short the short, [inaudible 00:09:35] Robinhood. We’re all guessing at this point as to what went on. So yeah, there should be an investigation. Marc Steiner: So pick up on that, Arun, and especially with your theories about what really happened here. Arun Gupta: Well, so I think if we look at it from a broader historical perspective, there’s a lot of rage at what’s going on. If you read these message boards on Reddit and on stock websites, you could see a lot of anger at the 2008 bailout. First of all, Wall Street basically wrecked the economy. They engaged in this just epic criminality, blatant fraud. Companies like Goldman Sachs that were marketing mortgages and mortgage backed securities, even as they were betting against them, this ended up crashing the US and the global economy, basically. The subprime mortgage crisis cost Americans something like $13 trillion dollars. And yet what happened was the Obama administration moved heaven and earth to bail them out. No one went to jail for this. There was reports that the FBI was ready to move on many different cases. And in the case of Goldman Sachs, it went from something like $1 trillion in debt to record profitability within a year. And this was done on essentially the backs of workers and the middle class. There’s this famous quote from Tim Geithner about foaming the runway, which he meant that they wanted to essentially see all these defaults in mortgages to help the banks get them off the books. And we saw something like 8 million foreclosures, many of them were of completely fraudulent, and the banks ended up paying some fines, but it just wound up as being a cost of doing business. It’s pretty much the same exact way that a chemical company like Dow or ExxonMobil will dump toxins in the environment, will pollute, then they just pay a fine, because in the end, they’re going to walk away with much more money.  And this is the part of the backdrop for what’s going on. But then we also have to understand that Wall Street has become this giant casino. Let me give a little illustration of this. There’s this stock that everyone’s likely heard about, Tesla, the electric vehicle company. It’s seen its valuation soar to stratospheric levels. It’s nearing $1 trillion in value. It’s a small car maker. Its owner, Elon Musk, is basically neck and neck with Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the world, worth about $180 billion.  The thing about companies, Wall Street has just almost an endless variety of ways to quantify how much they’re worth. And one of the oldest and most standard ways is a price to earnings ratio. Now say you have a company like Apple. This is just for illustration. Their stock price is $15. In the last 12 months, they’ve made $1 in profit. So you divide the share price $15, by the profit $1, and that is called a price, price of stocks, to earnings ratio. That’s 15. And that is considered about the historical norm.  Tesla has a price to earnings ratio of $1,700, which means you would have to hold that stock for 1,700 years to make your money back. And because Tesla has soared so much, last year we started to see this huge bubble in other electric vehicles stocks. This comes back to Bill’s point about short selling, and the short sellers actually often serve a very important function.  Now, in the case of what’s going on with GameStop, you had a highly leveraged hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that basically got in over its head. But in the electric vehicle sector, there’s this company called Nikola that, and it’s Nikola Tesla, right? It’s trying to even trade off the name of Tesla. It’s basically a giant fraud, and it has been exposed by a short seller. And yet it saw its price soar in 2020.  This gets caught up with something else called SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies. Now, this is just a complete scam where you have essentially these shell companies that go public and say, “Hey, we’re going to acquire another company,” and this whole sector took off in 2020. And when you see the sectors, what they’re investing in, it’s all these basically bubble stocks, it’s electric vehicles, sports gambling, marijuana, space exploration. And I talked to an institutional manager who said like, “Look, the CEOs of these SPACs, they’re incompetent. If they’re so great, why are they a CEO of these shell companies?”  So what you saw with Nikola was it stocks soared and then crashed, so lots of people get left holding the bag. And this company, they actually had a demo, they are supposed to be making electric trucks. They had to demo a few years ago where they made this video of this truck moving on a road and it turned out, this short seller exposed it, that they towed the truck to the top of a hill and let it go, right? This is a total metaphor for Wall Street. It’s just as a complete scam constantly. And that’s not to say there aren’t companies that do real things, make real products. Of course there are, but what people see is just this giant bubble economy, they don’t necessarily understand it, but they know this is being backstopped by the state.  We’ve had the Federal Reserve engage in quantitative easing in this easy money. The Dow Jones has soared something like 60% since its lows last March. American US billionaires have added $1.1 trillion to their wealth, even as we’re approaching 500,000 deaths, half a million deaths. So people get a sense that they are being screwed, and someone figured out like, “Hey, here’s a way to get back at Wall Street.”So they started to, and now we see this manipulation by Robinhood and other brokers where they’re shutting down the trades, even as they are making money. They’re in league, essentially with these big institutions.  The last point is, Robinhood is this free trading platform. And this is a rule of the internet economy. If something is free, you’re the product, right? With Google, with Facebook. That’s exactly what’s going on with Robinhood, is they’re selling people’s data to these market makers and the market makers are then using them to trade. And one, their main market maker, Citadel, they have the owner of it, this guy, Griffin, he invested all this money in the hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that took a bath from the GameStop fiasco. So it’s all this kind of like, it has the appearance of just all this dirty dealing. And it confirms to people that the game is rigged against them. Marc Steiner: So I think this is an important point here to just kind of just hone in on a couple aspects here. On one hand, Elizabeth Warren said about the need now to really regulate Wall Street and regulate the financial markets and to [inaudible 00:18:06] investigation, you’ve got people like on the left, Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, who was talking about investigating Robinhood, the same thing Cruz says, they wanted to investigate Robinhood. And as soon as I heard that, my first thought was, “Well, it goes way beyond Robinhood. This has to do with a systemic issue here.” So how do you deal with that? And how do you address what comes next? Because it’s communities where people who … on the one hand, you see AOC saying, “We have to investigate this, but I’m not working with Cruz. He tried to kill me.” So that was … which I understand what that means, but the question really is here, what does it mean to regulate Wall Street? How can you do it?  How do you stop this kind of gaming behavior, and what the hell does that have to do with our lives and our economy and our paychecks? I think those are the two things people are most concerned about. So let’s wrestle with that for a moment. So what does that mean to kind of take this on in the way Elizabeth Warren said, and does it have to go even beyond that. So as pithy as we can, let’s jump into it, and Bill, go ahead. Then, Arun, jump in, let’s have this out. Bill Black: Okay. Again, it means an enormous change probably in the way we think about securities regulation, because it is conceived of as simply an information system, as opposed to dealing with the essentially rigged nature of things. We just heard an absolutely true thing. Anything that’s supposedly free, ain’t free. And since we’re talking about GameStop, I mean, virtually all the free games on the internet are predatory, designed to hook young males into spending hundreds of dollars a year to play to win type of thing. So this is ubiquitous across the product space and the information space. So part of what’s going on is selling all of our information, everything in Facebook, et cetera, is to get you to click and give them information. Because as soon as they get information, they monetize the information. So that’s a second area we haven’t talked about at all, it’s probably bigger in terms of classic manipulation. And that is the hyper velocity traders, because the hyper velocity traders are the market these days, right? In most spheres.  Yeah, we’ve seen the power of Reddit, but remember this is going to end badly for the people that go in, because GameStop in fact was overvalued, not undervalued. And it’s now massively overvalued, which means people are buying it for PE ratios that are not Tesla insane, but are insane. By the way, Musk is a big cheerleader of this process as well. And if Musk is the cheerleader, we should be very careful about joining team Musk on anything. He has not got our interests in mind.  So the hypervelocity trading’s a huge thing, and it involves all kinds of front running and it involves all kinds of insider information. We’ve got a guy that owns one of the principal major league teams now, whose whole thing was insider trading, where the Justice Department refused to prosecute him. Prosecuted something like 11 of his chief lieutenants. Most of them successfully. Although, the Second Circuit reversed a number of the convictions, which is another key story, by the way, how we’ve made it next to impossible to get convictions in a lot of these cases and how we’ve allowed political corruption to essentially be something that can’t be prosecuted in the United States, because all of these things come back to, if you’ve got large private sector corruption, you’ve got large public sector corruption, at least with a small C going on in the process.  Musk is a big cheerleader of this process as well. And if Musk is the cheerleader, we should be very careful about joining team Musk on anything. He has not got our interests in mind.  So there’s enormous accounting fraud still. There’s enormous insider trading. We’ve got hedge funds that dominate, huge part, the Mercers that we’ve talked about in the past, just absolutely toxic in terms of American life. Then we have tax cuts. So what do incredibly wealthy people do if you give them a trillion additional dollars? They don’t buy more yachts, in truth. They don’t have time to buy things, right? They buy stock. And what happens if you increase demand for stock by $1 trillion? Well, you’re going to get a huge rise in stock price. Who is that going to spur the wealth of? Who is going to withdraw from stock markets? And when did they withdraw? They withdrew with the Great Depression. They withdrew with the collapse of the .com bubble. They had started to come back and they collapsed with the great financial crisis. So the market isn’t considered safe for regular people. And by the way, Reddit’s a community, these things, of young-ish males who, yes, have rage against everything and are … they do really weird stuff. And it works because momentum always works in the short run, if you can get lots of momentum. So this is geeky, Rho, Rho, Rho, your boat. Rho is the symbol for momentum in physics, right?  But in the longer run, it too is going to end badly. And by the way, they manipulate stocks as well. And they’re well into it. And it’s going to be one scandal after another, because what’s the most famous scam along these lines? It’s got a name. It’s called pump and dump, and that is happening, I guarantee you right now. You pump up the price, you dump it. The chumps that come in later suffer the massive losses. Marc Steiner: So, let me get to the question here. The biggest question in the end is [inaudible 00:24:53], and I think that [crosstalk 00:24:54]- Bill Black: It’s not one thing is my point, Marc. There’s isn’t a fix- Marc Steiner: No, I understand that.  Bill Black: This is a profoundly corrupt, as my colleague has just explained, system. It needs fixes in large numbers of areas, including stuff we’ve talked about in the past of, how do you restore the FBI? How do you restore the SEC? How do you restore the Department of Justice? Arun Gupta: I think we can also do simple things, like have a tax on trading that would discourage the high volume trading, a wealth tax. But that takes political will. It takes essentially people organized, the society organized. And a lot of what we’ve seen for decades is this type of … essentially billionaires are worshiped in our society. And the media, mainstream media play a huge role in that. And of course, a lot of them are owned by these same exact billionaires now, like Jeff Bezos, Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone, Disney. So the problem is we have this kind of like self-reinforcing system where it’s just like, there’s all this chicanery going on, but they never point the finger and say, “The problem is the billionaires.” And when someone like Bernie Sanders does, he’s the skunk at the garden party who farted. Marc Steiner: So if we were sitting in Congress at this moment and you have Cruz and a Ocasio Cortez on similar pages and other people saying … at least in terms of what they’re saying to the press, the question becomes, what does happen? And one of the things that you looked at in 2008 was one of the reasons that people lost confidence in the Democrats was because of the way the game was played in 2008 in the bailout. That was a huge part of what happened to them. So the question becomes, if you’re going to push an agenda that is going to benefit of the entire country and benefit the people of this country, what is it people need to understand, and what is it people need to be pushing in order to address what we’re facing with Wall Street in our economy? I think that’s the question people really want to understand. Bill Black: Well, again, I agree that there are a large number of steps that we have to be thinking very broadly and including things like taxes. But if you want to single start in this political space we have now, it’s to have the Pecora style hearing- Marc Steiner: Which means what? Bill Black: This is not the five-minute questioning by one party versus another. This is professional questioning that goes on for hours, then you let the politician have a little face time at the end. The Australians did this with a Royal Commission recently, and they did it right. So it had all the facts, it had numbers, but it always told a story. It was always a narrative. It was always, “Here’s a real person,” or a series of real people, “And this is the terrible thing that happened to their lives. And it hasn’t just been a one-off. It’s due to these policies and practice. These incentives created by the bosses.” That not only educates people to the real problem, it creates the rare political space to be able to have substantial changes. This requires a very different way of thinking about how we approach it. It’s going to have many facets. It’s going to have tax facets. It’s going to have regulatory facets. It’s going to be prosecutions, but largely you have to blow the lid, because when you take the lid off, it’s going to be maggots, right? Creepy, crawly maggots everywhere. Marc Steiner: Arun, go ahead. Arun Gupta: Oh, well I was just going to say, I know from plenty of people on Twitter, their solution is guillotines on Wall Street. Marc Steiner: What sort of guillotines? Bill Black: Well, that’s seriously sort of a problem. These are the same approaches that led to the attack on the Capitol, right? Yes, it is rage, but it’s also weirdly focused. It’s manipulated by the real problems, people like Musk taking leadership roles. This will end very badly if we allow it to continue because yeah, their heroes aren’t cowboys, it’s billionaires. Arun Gupta: Yeah. And I think it is very important to also remember there is this very much as fascist threat, right? Fascists have always railed against elites, always railed against bankers, which is just a euphemism for Jews. This can very easily veer into antisemitism. We see Donald Trump made antisemitism great again. And we have this political force- Bill Black: Jewish space lasers are a real thing. I mean, let’s- Arun Gupta: Well, if you’ve seen a Mel Brooks’ History of the World there’s, yeah, the giant Jewish space station star of David. He has the documentary evidence. But this, yes, there a real danger. People have talked about how on Wall Street Bets, one of the founders, that they had to clean it up because there was these chat rooms that were filled with white supremacists and neo-Nazis and antisemites. There is this kind of like, certainly this frat boy mentality, but that veers a lot into Trumpism.  As someone who has been covering the fascist right for years, I understand what Bill’s saying. And I’ve heard a lot of people, including the institutional fund manager I was talking to make that analogy with 1/6, that this is like the storming of the Capitol. And yeah, I think there’s a very broad similarities, but that obviously was something also a very different, but there is this late danger that this does not go left in terms of, “Hey, let’s like create a healthier progressive society,” but that this goes in this direction of far right extremism. Marc Steiner: So, I mean, we don’t have very much time here, but I mean, the point I’m trying to get to here is, what exactly should Congress be doing to address the issue? Because, A, there’s a serious danger of how it can affect a larger economy, and B, that you can’t let this manipulation continue. And the question is, they’ve got to drill down to begin to end it, to control it. And that seems to be the question here, what do they do? Arun Gupta: I mean, Bill would know a hell of a lot better than me. I would say like, do we need to break up the big banks, but is that possible in this world? I know the economist Rick Wolf makes the point that it’s just like, “Look, if governments wanted to, they could really shut down this kind of flow of hidden wealth that, when they wanted to, they took all this action in concert to shut down financing of Al Qaeda and these other type of religious extremist groups around the world. Well, why can’t they shut down all this kind of hidden money tax havens? They could easily do that. We know where they all are, such as in The Bahamas and elsewhere.” So there are actions that can be taken. It’s just, who? The system is still rigged. Not just the financial system, but the ideological system. Bill Black: So that they come back to sunlight as a disinfectant, the brand ICN idea, get the facts out. It’s one thing to know the system is rigged, and that can lead to all kinds of things, including in America and most places in the world, blaming Jews, right? It’s another thing to say, “No, no, here’s the 17 ways that it’s rigged that we can change and need to change.” Right? And they will be broad and there’ll be in many areas, but you have to start by getting the facts out and getting the facts out in a way that actually identified the people who are the real perpetrators. You don’t leave this story, “Well, oh, somehow it’s mysteriously rigged. It must be the Jews.” Instead, “Here’s exactly how it is rigged.” And Real News has, over the years put on a whole series of people who have been telling that story of not, “Well, the system’s rigged.” But, “Here are the specific ways in which it’s rigged,” right? So for example, marginal tax rates. Marginal tax rates on these people are absurdly low, and effectively when they go off shore or when they go to Delaware in the United States, they can reduce their taxes to pretty close to zero. But a lot of that has been created in the legal system. David K Johnston and others have been talking about this for decades, but there’s no reason has to be just on Real News. It could be happening every day. The Democrats control the committees and subcommittees. They could be holding real honest to God hearings with the power of subpoena, but using professionals. They can create the rules and they can say, “Questioning will be done by staff attorneys,” and then they could go and hire really good staff attorneys who are great at this type of stuff. And then as I said, they get their five minutes of face time at the end of all of this process. And it would actually be good for them. They would become famous for holding those kinds of hearings, right. But we call it the Pecora hearing for a reason. This is Ferdinand Pecora, who did the successful investigation after a couple of initial attempts and failed in the response to the Great Depression, a Republican appointed by Republicans, right? Somebody that could never rise to the top in Tammany because he was known to be honest. He was not an expert in financial markets. He was an expert in mobs, turned out that was the relevant expertise, right?  He got together with, as his key aid? An investigative reporter who knew where the bodies were buried and then used the congressional authority to get the facts of, as I said, that not only created the structural basis for change, it created the political space because he discredited the world’s top bankers in America, humiliated them in their testimony when the facts came out. We can do that. We’re actually really good at producing those kinds of lawyers that can do that kind of questioning. It’s one of our skill sets still, but you do not see them when members of Congress are doing their five minutes and asking their non questions that are really statements. Marc Steiner: Well, I think that what we’ve talked about here is really important. And I think that one of the things maybe to follow up on together is just as this thing unfolds is to do that critique in how this happens so people can see it. I think that what you just said, what both you just said is critical to where the future is going to go. And I want to get you both back on here to kind of hone in on this as we see how this unfolds in the coming weeks, if it unfolds and where it goes. I don’t think Cruz is a Pecora, but we’ll see. Arun Gupta: If I can make actually one last comment towards your point.  Marc Steiner: Yeah. Very quick, though. Yeah. Arun Gupta: We’re coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street, and they warned us about this, right? And that had the ruling class, at least for a moment, shaking in their Guccis. So when you have the mob on Wall Street calling to get the bankers out of the politics, out of the political control, that’s I think central to change. That you do need the mob, but they were peaceful mob calling for action. We need to see that again. We’re coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street, and they warned us about this, right? And that had the ruling class, at least for a moment, shaking in their Guccis. Marc Steiner: I remember that very well, reported from the middle of that mob the whole time. So, yes. Arun Gupta and Bill Black, thank you both so much for joining us here on The Real News. It’s great to have you with us. Really was, good discussion. And I’m Marc Steiner here on the Marc Steiner Show for The Real News Network. Thank you all for joining us. Please go to that email address, MSS@TheRealNews.com, let us know what you think and what we should be covering and how you thought about this and what else you’d like to know about. So for The Real News, thank you so much for joining us and take care. Between r/wallstreetbets, short selling, and a lot of GameStop stock, things have certainly been interesting on the stock market of late, but who are the real winners and losers here? And what does the #GameStonks saga reveal about the nature of the stock market and the function it actually serves in our society? For this segment of “The Marc Steiner Show,” Marc is joined by investigative journalist Arun Gupta, whose work has been featured in outlets like the Washington Post, The Intercept, The Nation, Raw Story, The Guardian, and Jacobin; and Bill Black, associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas, white-collar criminologist and former financial regulator, and author of the book “The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One.” Listen to full podcast episodes of “The Marc Steiner Show.” \n",

      " Content: Marc Steiner: Hello, I’m Marc Steiner. And welcome to the Marc Steiner Show right here on The Real News Network. Good to have you all with us. Well, last week we saw Wall Street in a tizzy because a group of Redditors on Wall Street Bets forum worked in tandem to use stock trading apps like Robinhood to collectively invest in stock for video game retailer GameStop, driving that stock price way up in a matter of hours and causing giant losses for many wealthy investors and hedge funds that were trying to short sell that stock.  Now, other wealthy investors made a killing. The financial world began to reel at the hands of these online renegades, or are they really renegades? And it wasn’t just GameStop. Other businesses that are heavily targeted for short selling are places like AMC entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and they all got swept up in this Reddit led charge. Then the fun became to an abrupt end when Robinhood and other platforms imposed strict restrictions on traders, effectively stopping their ability to buy shares in GameStop and other select stocks. Now, this move has prompted outcries and accusations of game rigging by people across the political spectrum. And just imagine now, I’m talking about Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the Congresswoman and Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Elizabeth Warren. And on Friday, Warren said, her quote was, “For years, the stock market has been less and less about the value of business and more and more like casino gambling. GameStop is just the latest and most visible example. We need to take this not as a one-off problem, but as a systemic problem that requires systemic regulation and enforcement.” And so there’s a lot going on here, and what has unfolded has huge implications. We know that viewers like us here at The Real News have a lot of questions about what is really going on here, exactly what happened on Wall Street and how that affects us, why it’s important and what it means for us all going forward. What’s it mean for our retirements? Well, let’s start here, Bill Black is back. Good to have you back, Bill.  Bill Black: Thank you.  Marc Steiner: Bill’s an associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas city, he’s a white color criminologist, former financial regulator and author of the book The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One. Also, joining us again is Arun Gupta. Arun’s back with us. Arun, welcome back.  Arun Gupta: Great to be with you.  Marc Steiner: He is a noted journalist who has written for the Washington Post, The Nation, Raw Story, Guardian, Jacobin, many other places. He’s a graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York, and working on his book, which is called Bacon as a Weapon of Mass Destruction, a Junk Food Loving Chef’s Inquiry Into Taste, which might be very fitting for today’s discussion. So good to have you both here. Can we just start with this? Can we just start … and, Bill, I’ll jump to you first if you don’t mind. Just a very, very short, a quick lesson in what these terms mean, like short sale. I think people have a hard time grasping what kind of game is being played. Bill Black: Okay. So the very idea that short sale is a game is itself problematic, right? You’re betting one direction. You’re always betting. Why betting one direction is considered a game and the other direction is not considered a game is quite unclear. And bizarrely, not necessarily these short sellers, but the short sellers tend to be often the people closest aligned with the public interest, as opposed to the folks who are going long, which is of course the opposite.  So first really basic point that picks up on your basic point, this is all just the secondary market. This is not the primary market. The primary market is the initial public offerings. The IPO’s. That’s what actually gets capital to accompany that it could invest, right? That’s the whole theory why we’re doing this thing. So we have this elaborate, massive secondary market. Why? Because when markets are broad, deep is another phrase for them, it means whole lot of trades. They tend to be more efficient. Or if you want to phrase it the other way, less inefficient, harder to scam and such, right?  To make this seamless market where you can just go in on, today your app and actually buy a stock and such, we have behind the scenes market makers, which is one of the reasons when we have a great financial crisis, things go to hell in seconds, right? Soon nanoseconds, because the market makers fail. There’s not somebody always on the other side of a trade magically at the price, even in the ballpark of the price you’re trying to buy or sell. So these market makers come in, and if price is falling precipitously, they go bankrupt. In which case, then trading ceases. When trading ceases, what’s the value of an asset if you can’t sell it? So having deep markets, having a efficient markets is actually a good thing for the world. And that’s the theory, the whole idea of the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission is an information regime. We give you more reliable information and that means you can make these decisions. And this got coupled with, to your point, this has nothing frigging to do with the economy, the real economy. We can’t emphasize that enough. The real economy is one thing and the whole financial system is another thing. To call it a casino is like to be shocked in Casa Blanca [crosstalk 00:06:19] that’s why it frigging exists in large part. Okay? One of the ways you can bet, and the reason it can be on the side of the quasi-angels, is a company is highly overvalued in its stock price. Why? Well, often because the CEO is looting the place and cheating and engaging in accounting fraud, right? Charles Keating was famously a beset by shorts, right? Because people figured out that he was scamming things. The great financial crisis, we have all seen the movie now, The Big Short, right? You have unbelievable overstatement in the real economy of asset values. Well, how do you bet against it? You bet that the price is going to fall. You enter into borrowing transaction, and you pledge that you’re going to buy shares or delivered shares that you don’t have. And that’s great if the price falls, but if it doesn’t, then it’s a world of hurt, but there’s something worse, and that is called a short squeeze. And a short squeeze is famous. Cornelius Vanderbilt did this to another robber Barron, Drew. Drew did a whole shorting in league with corrupt politicians and they targeted Vanderbilt. What was he thinking? And Vanderbilt got his own corrupt politicians and did a short squeeze. And what that means is, back to this broad markets versus very thin markets. These markets get super thin when it comes to lots and lots of trading. So the shorts have to bid back to get the stock, but the stock skyrocketing in value and they bet it was going to fall from roughly 32 to somewhere in the twenties. And now it’s in the three hundreds and four hundreds at times. That’s when they completely go bankrupt, literally. And in this case it was a hedge fund or a couple of hedge funds that specialized in shorting. And when people got together and said, “Screw fundamental values, let’s all buy GameStop,” Then it rose in price. And the entity, the hedge fund shorting couldn’t deliver the shares and actually got bailed out in the first instance. Then as you say, there’s a dispute. Did Robinhood voluntarily stop in league with others, or did it really come up against its capital limits? Because capital limits actually do exist, and it wouldn’t be illogical that they came up against the capital limits, but without knowing more [inaudible 00:09:33] we may have to short the short, [inaudible 00:09:35] Robinhood. We’re all guessing at this point as to what went on. So yeah, there should be an investigation. Marc Steiner: So pick up on that, Arun, and especially with your theories about what really happened here. Arun Gupta: Well, so I think if we look at it from a broader historical perspective, there’s a lot of rage at what’s going on. If you read these message boards on Reddit and on stock websites, you could see a lot of anger at the 2008 bailout. First of all, Wall Street basically wrecked the economy. They engaged in this just epic criminality, blatant fraud. Companies like Goldman Sachs that were marketing mortgages and mortgage backed securities, even as they were betting against them, this ended up crashing the US and the global economy, basically. The subprime mortgage crisis cost Americans something like $13 trillion dollars. And yet what happened was the Obama administration moved heaven and earth to bail them out. No one went to jail for this. There was reports that the FBI was ready to move on many different cases. And in the case of Goldman Sachs, it went from something like $1 trillion in debt to record profitability within a year. And this was done on essentially the backs of workers and the middle class. There’s this famous quote from Tim Geithner about foaming the runway, which he meant that they wanted to essentially see all these defaults in mortgages to help the banks get them off the books. And we saw something like 8 million foreclosures, many of them were of completely fraudulent, and the banks ended up paying some fines, but it just wound up as being a cost of doing business. It’s pretty much the same exact way that a chemical company like Dow or ExxonMobil will dump toxins in the environment, will pollute, then they just pay a fine, because in the end, they’re going to walk away with much more money.  And this is the part of the backdrop for what’s going on. But then we also have to understand that Wall Street has become this giant casino. Let me give a little illustration of this. There’s this stock that everyone’s likely heard about, Tesla, the electric vehicle company. It’s seen its valuation soar to stratospheric levels. It’s nearing $1 trillion in value. It’s a small car maker. Its owner, Elon Musk, is basically neck and neck with Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the world, worth about $180 billion.  The thing about companies, Wall Street has just almost an endless variety of ways to quantify how much they’re worth. And one of the oldest and most standard ways is a price to earnings ratio. Now say you have a company like Apple. This is just for illustration. Their stock price is $15. In the last 12 months, they’ve made $1 in profit. So you divide the share price $15, by the profit $1, and that is called a price, price of stocks, to earnings ratio. That’s 15. And that is considered about the historical norm.  Tesla has a price to earnings ratio of $1,700, which means you would have to hold that stock for 1,700 years to make your money back. And because Tesla has soared so much, last year we started to see this huge bubble in other electric vehicles stocks. This comes back to Bill’s point about short selling, and the short sellers actually often serve a very important function.  Now, in the case of what’s going on with GameStop, you had a highly leveraged hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that basically got in over its head. But in the electric vehicle sector, there’s this company called Nikola that, and it’s Nikola Tesla, right? It’s trying to even trade off the name of Tesla. It’s basically a giant fraud, and it has been exposed by a short seller. And yet it saw its price soar in 2020.  This gets caught up with something else called SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies. Now, this is just a complete scam where you have essentially these shell companies that go public and say, “Hey, we’re going to acquire another company,” and this whole sector took off in 2020. And when you see the sectors, what they’re investing in, it’s all these basically bubble stocks, it’s electric vehicles, sports gambling, marijuana, space exploration. And I talked to an institutional manager who said like, “Look, the CEOs of these SPACs, they’re incompetent. If they’re so great, why are they a CEO of these shell companies?”  So what you saw with Nikola was it stocks soared and then crashed, so lots of people get left holding the bag. And this company, they actually had a demo, they are supposed to be making electric trucks. They had to demo a few years ago where they made this video of this truck moving on a road and it turned out, this short seller exposed it, that they towed the truck to the top of a hill and let it go, right? This is a total metaphor for Wall Street. It’s just as a complete scam constantly. And that’s not to say there aren’t companies that do real things, make real products. Of course there are, but what people see is just this giant bubble economy, they don’t necessarily understand it, but they know this is being backstopped by the state.  We’ve had the Federal Reserve engage in quantitative easing in this easy money. The Dow Jones has soared something like 60% since its lows last March. American US billionaires have added $1.1 trillion to their wealth, even as we’re approaching 500,000 deaths, half a million deaths. So people get a sense that they are being screwed, and someone figured out like, “Hey, here’s a way to get back at Wall Street.”So they started to, and now we see this manipulation by Robinhood and other brokers where they’re shutting down the trades, even as they are making money. They’re in league, essentially with these big institutions.  The last point is, Robinhood is this free trading platform. And this is a rule of the internet economy. If something is free, you’re the product, right? With Google, with Facebook. That’s exactly what’s going on with Robinhood, is they’re selling people’s data to these market makers and the market makers are then using them to trade. And one, their main market maker, Citadel, they have the owner of it, this guy, Griffin, he invested all this money in the hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that took a bath from the GameStop fiasco. So it’s all this kind of like, it has the appearance of just all this dirty dealing. And it confirms to people that the game is rigged against them. Marc Steiner: So I think this is an important point here to just kind of just hone in on a couple aspects here. On one hand, Elizabeth Warren said about the need now to really regulate Wall Street and regulate the financial markets and to [inaudible 00:18:06] investigation, you’ve got people like on the left, Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, who was talking about investigating Robinhood, the same thing Cruz says, they wanted to investigate Robinhood. And as soon as I heard that, my first thought was, “Well, it goes way beyond Robinhood. This has to do with a systemic issue here.” So how do you deal with that? And how do you address what comes next? Because it’s communities where people who … on the one hand, you see AOC saying, “We have to investigate this, but I’m not working with Cruz. He tried to kill me.” So that was … which I understand what that means, but the question really is here, what does it mean to regulate Wall Street? How can you do it?  How do you stop this kind of gaming behavior, and what the hell does that have to do with our lives and our economy and our paychecks? I think those are the two things people are most concerned about. So let’s wrestle with that for a moment. So what does that mean to kind of take this on in the way Elizabeth Warren said, and does it have to go even beyond that. So as pithy as we can, let’s jump into it, and Bill, go ahead. Then, Arun, jump in, let’s have this out. Bill Black: Okay. Again, it means an enormous change probably in the way we think about securities regulation, because it is conceived of as simply an information system, as opposed to dealing with the essentially rigged nature of things. We just heard an absolutely true thing. Anything that’s supposedly free, ain’t free. And since we’re talking about GameStop, I mean, virtually all the free games on the internet are predatory, designed to hook young males into spending hundreds of dollars a year to play to win type of thing. So this is ubiquitous across the product space and the information space. So part of what’s going on is selling all of our information, everything in Facebook, et cetera, is to get you to click and give them information. Because as soon as they get information, they monetize the information. So that’s a second area we haven’t talked about at all, it’s probably bigger in terms of classic manipulation. And that is the hyper velocity traders, because the hyper velocity traders are the market these days, right? In most spheres.  Yeah, we’ve seen the power of Reddit, but remember this is going to end badly for the people that go in, because GameStop in fact was overvalued, not undervalued. And it’s now massively overvalued, which means people are buying it for PE ratios that are not Tesla insane, but are insane. By the way, Musk is a big cheerleader of this process as well. And if Musk is the cheerleader, we should be very careful about joining team Musk on anything. He has not got our interests in mind.  So the hypervelocity trading’s a huge thing, and it involves all kinds of front running and it involves all kinds of insider information. We’ve got a guy that owns one of the principal major league teams now, whose whole thing was insider trading, where the Justice Department refused to prosecute him. Prosecuted something like 11 of his chief lieutenants. Most of them successfully. Although, the Second Circuit reversed a number of the convictions, which is another key story, by the way, how we’ve made it next to impossible to get convictions in a lot of these cases and how we’ve allowed political corruption to essentially be something that can’t be prosecuted in the United States, because all of these things come back to, if you’ve got large private sector corruption, you’ve got large public sector corruption, at least with a small C going on in the process.  Musk is a big cheerleader of this process as well. And if Musk is the cheerleader, we should be very careful about joining team Musk on anything. He has not got our interests in mind.  So there’s enormous accounting fraud still. There’s enormous insider trading. We’ve got hedge funds that dominate, huge part, the Mercers that we’ve talked about in the past, just absolutely toxic in terms of American life. Then we have tax cuts. So what do incredibly wealthy people do if you give them a trillion additional dollars? They don’t buy more yachts, in truth. They don’t have time to buy things, right? They buy stock. And what happens if you increase demand for stock by $1 trillion? Well, you’re going to get a huge rise in stock price. Who is that going to spur the wealth of? Who is going to withdraw from stock markets? And when did they withdraw? They withdrew with the Great Depression. They withdrew with the collapse of the .com bubble. They had started to come back and they collapsed with the great financial crisis. So the market isn’t considered safe for regular people. And by the way, Reddit’s a community, these things, of young-ish males who, yes, have rage against everything and are … they do really weird stuff. And it works because momentum always works in the short run, if you can get lots of momentum. So this is geeky, Rho, Rho, Rho, your boat. Rho is the symbol for momentum in physics, right?  But in the longer run, it too is going to end badly. And by the way, they manipulate stocks as well. And they’re well into it. And it’s going to be one scandal after another, because what’s the most famous scam along these lines? It’s got a name. It’s called pump and dump, and that is happening, I guarantee you right now. You pump up the price, you dump it. The chumps that come in later suffer the massive losses. Marc Steiner: So, let me get to the question here. The biggest question in the end is [inaudible 00:24:53], and I think that [crosstalk 00:24:54]- Bill Black: It’s not one thing is my point, Marc. There’s isn’t a fix- Marc Steiner: No, I understand that.  Bill Black: This is a profoundly corrupt, as my colleague has just explained, system. It needs fixes in large numbers of areas, including stuff we’ve talked about in the past of, how do you restore the FBI? How do you restore the SEC? How do you restore the Department of Justice? Arun Gupta: I think we can also do simple things, like have a tax on trading that would discourage the high volume trading, a wealth tax. But that takes political will. It takes essentially people organized, the society organized. And a lot of what we’ve seen for decades is this type of … essentially billionaires are worshiped in our society. And the media, mainstream media play a huge role in that. And of course, a lot of them are owned by these same exact billionaires now, like Jeff Bezos, Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone, Disney. So the problem is we have this kind of like self-reinforcing system where it’s just like, there’s all this chicanery going on, but they never point the finger and say, “The problem is the billionaires.” And when someone like Bernie Sanders does, he’s the skunk at the garden party who farted. Marc Steiner: So if we were sitting in Congress at this moment and you have Cruz and a Ocasio Cortez on similar pages and other people saying … at least in terms of what they’re saying to the press, the question becomes, what does happen? And one of the things that you looked at in 2008 was one of the reasons that people lost confidence in the Democrats was because of the way the game was played in 2008 in the bailout. That was a huge part of what happened to them. So the question becomes, if you’re going to push an agenda that is going to benefit of the entire country and benefit the people of this country, what is it people need to understand, and what is it people need to be pushing in order to address what we’re facing with Wall Street in our economy? I think that’s the question people really want to understand. Bill Black: Well, again, I agree that there are a large number of steps that we have to be thinking very broadly and including things like taxes. But if you want to single start in this political space we have now, it’s to have the Pecora style hearing- Marc Steiner: Which means what? Bill Black: This is not the five-minute questioning by one party versus another. This is professional questioning that goes on for hours, then you let the politician have a little face time at the end. The Australians did this with a Royal Commission recently, and they did it right. So it had all the facts, it had numbers, but it always told a story. It was always a narrative. It was always, “Here’s a real person,” or a series of real people, “And this is the terrible thing that happened to their lives. And it hasn’t just been a one-off. It’s due to these policies and practice. These incentives created by the bosses.” That not only educates people to the real problem, it creates the rare political space to be able to have substantial changes. This requires a very different way of thinking about how we approach it. It’s going to have many facets. It’s going to have tax facets. It’s going to have regulatory facets. It’s going to be prosecutions, but largely you have to blow the lid, because when you take the lid off, it’s going to be maggots, right? Creepy, crawly maggots everywhere. Marc Steiner: Arun, go ahead. Arun Gupta: Oh, well I was just going to say, I know from plenty of people on Twitter, their solution is guillotines on Wall Street. Marc Steiner: What sort of guillotines? Bill Black: Well, that’s seriously sort of a problem. These are the same approaches that led to the attack on the Capitol, right? Yes, it is rage, but it’s also weirdly focused. It’s manipulated by the real problems, people like Musk taking leadership roles. This will end very badly if we allow it to continue because yeah, their heroes aren’t cowboys, it’s billionaires. Arun Gupta: Yeah. And I think it is very important to also remember there is this very much as fascist threat, right? Fascists have always railed against elites, always railed against bankers, which is just a euphemism for Jews. This can very easily veer into antisemitism. We see Donald Trump made antisemitism great again. And we have this political force- Bill Black: Jewish space lasers are a real thing. I mean, let’s- Arun Gupta: Well, if you’ve seen a Mel Brooks’ History of the World there’s, yeah, the giant Jewish space station star of David. He has the documentary evidence. But this, yes, there a real danger. People have talked about how on Wall Street Bets, one of the founders, that they had to clean it up because there was these chat rooms that were filled with white supremacists and neo-Nazis and antisemites. There is this kind of like, certainly this frat boy mentality, but that veers a lot into Trumpism.  As someone who has been covering the fascist right for years, I understand what Bill’s saying. And I’ve heard a lot of people, including the institutional fund manager I was talking to make that analogy with 1/6, that this is like the storming of the Capitol. And yeah, I think there’s a very broad similarities, but that obviously was something also a very different, but there is this late danger that this does not go left in terms of, “Hey, let’s like create a healthier progressive society,” but that this goes in this direction of far right extremism. Marc Steiner: So, I mean, we don’t have very much time here, but I mean, the point I’m trying to get to here is, what exactly should Congress be doing to address the issue? Because, A, there’s a serious danger of how it can affect a larger economy, and B, that you can’t let this manipulation continue. And the question is, they’ve got to drill down to begin to end it, to control it. And that seems to be the question here, what do they do? Arun Gupta: I mean, Bill would know a hell of a lot better than me. I would say like, do we need to break up the big banks, but is that possible in this world? I know the economist Rick Wolf makes the point that it’s just like, “Look, if governments wanted to, they could really shut down this kind of flow of hidden wealth that, when they wanted to, they took all this action in concert to shut down financing of Al Qaeda and these other type of religious extremist groups around the world. Well, why can’t they shut down all this kind of hidden money tax havens? They could easily do that. We know where they all are, such as in The Bahamas and elsewhere.” So there are actions that can be taken. It’s just, who? The system is still rigged. Not just the financial system, but the ideological system. Bill Black: So that they come back to sunlight as a disinfectant, the brand ICN idea, get the facts out. It’s one thing to know the system is rigged, and that can lead to all kinds of things, including in America and most places in the world, blaming Jews, right? It’s another thing to say, “No, no, here’s the 17 ways that it’s rigged that we can change and need to change.” Right? And they will be broad and there’ll be in many areas, but you have to start by getting the facts out and getting the facts out in a way that actually identified the people who are the real perpetrators. You don’t leave this story, “Well, oh, somehow it’s mysteriously rigged. It must be the Jews.” Instead, “Here’s exactly how it is rigged.” And Real News has, over the years put on a whole series of people who have been telling that story of not, “Well, the system’s rigged.” But, “Here are the specific ways in which it’s rigged,” right? So for example, marginal tax rates. Marginal tax rates on these people are absurdly low, and effectively when they go off shore or when they go to Delaware in the United States, they can reduce their taxes to pretty close to zero. But a lot of that has been created in the legal system. David K Johnston and others have been talking about this for decades, but there’s no reason has to be just on Real News. It could be happening every day. The Democrats control the committees and subcommittees. They could be holding real honest to God hearings with the power of subpoena, but using professionals. They can create the rules and they can say, “Questioning will be done by staff attorneys,” and then they could go and hire really good staff attorneys who are great at this type of stuff. And then as I said, they get their five minutes of face time at the end of all of this process. And it would actually be good for them. They would become famous for holding those kinds of hearings, right. But we call it the Pecora hearing for a reason. This is Ferdinand Pecora, who did the successful investigation after a couple of initial attempts and failed in the response to the Great Depression, a Republican appointed by Republicans, right? Somebody that could never rise to the top in Tammany because he was known to be honest. He was not an expert in financial markets. He was an expert in mobs, turned out that was the relevant expertise, right?  He got together with, as his key aid? An investigative reporter who knew where the bodies were buried and then used the congressional authority to get the facts of, as I said, that not only created the structural basis for change, it created the political space because he discredited the world’s top bankers in America, humiliated them in their testimony when the facts came out. We can do that. We’re actually really good at producing those kinds of lawyers that can do that kind of questioning. It’s one of our skill sets still, but you do not see them when members of Congress are doing their five minutes and asking their non questions that are really statements. Marc Steiner: Well, I think that what we’ve talked about here is really important. And I think that one of the things maybe to follow up on together is just as this thing unfolds is to do that critique in how this happens so people can see it. I think that what you just said, what both you just said is critical to where the future is going to go. And I want to get you both back on here to kind of hone in on this as we see how this unfolds in the coming weeks, if it unfolds and where it goes. I don’t think Cruz is a Pecora, but we’ll see. Arun Gupta: If I can make actually one last comment towards your point.  Marc Steiner: Yeah. Very quick, though. Yeah. Arun Gupta: We’re coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street, and they warned us about this, right? And that had the ruling class, at least for a moment, shaking in their Guccis. So when you have the mob on Wall Street calling to get the bankers out of the politics, out of the political control, that’s I think central to change. That you do need the mob, but they were peaceful mob calling for action. We need to see that again. We’re coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street, and they warned us about this, right? And that had the ruling class, at least for a moment, shaking in their Guccis. Marc Steiner: I remember that very well, reported from the middle of that mob the whole time. So, yes. Arun Gupta and Bill Black, thank you both so much for joining us here on The Real News. It’s great to have you with us. Really was, good discussion. And I’m Marc Steiner here on the Marc Steiner Show for The Real News Network. Thank you all for joining us. Please go to that email address, MSS@TheRealNews.com, let us know what you think and what we should be covering and how you thought about this and what else you’d like to know about. So for The Real News, thank you so much for joining us and take care. Between r/wallstreetbets, short selling, and a lot of GameStop stock, things have certainly been interesting on the stock market of late, but who are the real winners and losers here? And what does the #GameStonks saga reveal about the nature of the stock market and the function it actually serves in our society? For this segment of “The Marc Steiner Show,” Marc is joined by investigative journalist Arun Gupta, whose work has been featured in outlets like the Washington Post, The Intercept, The Nation, Raw Story, The Guardian, and Jacobin; and Bill Black, associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas, white-collar criminologist and former financial regulator, and author of the book “The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One.” Listen to full podcast episodes of “The Marc Steiner Show.” \n",

      " Content: Marc Steiner: Good to have you all with us, and I’m Marc Steiner. We’re facing a pivotal moment for organized labor in this country. On the one hand, labor unions are at their lowest ebb in decades in terms of membership. But their power is bubbling up, bubbling just below the surface. The potential for union growth and power has never been greater. As our guest Rand Wilson points out in his article for Jacobin, we’re at a critical juncture. There are 450 collective bargaining agreements representing hundreds of thousands of workers set to expire in 2021. Many of those workers are public sector workers and essential workers that have kept us going through this pandemic. So it’s a critical time. Can there be public solidarity with union workers given that reality? On top of that, a critical piece of legislation called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act or PRO Act will be up before Congress. In the midst of all this, workers are organizing at Amazon and in tech industries around the country, especially in the warehouse level for the potential being akin to the power of steel, auto, and industrial unions at the birth of the modern labor unions. So there’s a lot going on with labor. So we’re about to have this conversation with Rand Wilson. Rand Wilson is a longtime union activist, and we’re going to explore the possibilities of the grand power of rising labor with him during the course of our conversation. He’s been labor organizing for decades and his chief of staff at the SEI Local 888 in Boston, who along with Peter Olney wrote this article that inspired this conversation today, from Jacobin, the article’s called, With Scores of Union Contracts Expiring 2021, Can This Be a Year of Mass Solidarity, and Rand joins us now to delve into all this more. Rand Wilson: Great to be here, Marc. Marc Steiner: Good to have you with us. So let’s just talk. Start with that, with this beginning thesis of your article, which is 450 contracts going up representing hundreds of thousands, 1.5 million workers, if I got the total right, adding them all up. Let’s talk about what that means. Where do you find yourselves now? Rand Wilson: What Peter and I did was, we just analyzed these agreements and broke them down by sector and by geography and by union industry, just to see where we might see some of the, what I would call flashpoints in the class struggle. These are places where we might see large groups of workers facing their employer, and more than likely contending with this kind of neoliberal austerity agenda that is going to be part of the drum beat that’s coming from employers, both public and private. And in so many of these cases, workers will be looking to their union to defend their wages and working conditions. And in fact, looking for some dignity and respect, that’s long overdue to people who have been on the front lines as essential workers in this COVID pandemic. And believe me, there’s probably thousands more contracts that are expiring. They’re just under 200 employees, so they didn’t come up in the data that we analyzed. But, there’s far more than a million and a half workers that will be facing their employers with expiring contracts in 2021, but we were able to analyze those agreements. And what we’re suggesting is just that, these are the places where we’re likely to see some class conflict occurring. And, that’s an opportunity from the standpoint of, as an organizer, that’s an opportunity to draw people to the labor movement and to attract more workers to the dialogue and discussion and real meaningful relationship that workers have through collective bargaining with their employer, a real say in their wages and working conditions that all but 93% of the workers in the private sector and many workers in the public sector, they don’t have that voice with their employer. They don’t have a way of sitting down and talking about their wages and working conditions through their representatives in collective bargaining. And so we think that these contracts are an opportunity to attract and educate those people who are not yet union about the benefits of collective bargaining and how the union is so important to defend and improve your wages and working conditions. Marc Steiner: So when you look at the reality, some of the polls I’ve been reading, talk about 50% of most private industry workers want unions, 65% of people in our country support labor unions. What we’re seeing is these agreements that are coming to the fore. So many of them also affect public employees, public health employees, hospital employees, teachers, the workers, the drivers in the postal service, drivers in the private parcel industry that have been working during this pandemic. And so the question is, we talked before we went on the air a little bit about the… It made me think about this, about the oil, chemical, atomic workers strike back in ’69 and how community members came out and really supported that union strike. And it was an intense strike. So it made me think of the… People have supported the teachers’ unions in Chicago, the places and their intense strikes and their work or actions. So it’s about where we are right now and what that possibility looks like and how you even get to the point where you get this kind of mass movement solidarity among unions, but also being kind of community together with unions as they face this change. I mean, is there potential there? How do you see it performing? Rand Wilson: One thing that unions are doing now, is as we go to the table, we’re beginning to frame our bargaining proposals around the public good. So what we’re doing is we’re increasingly linking the collective bargaining goals with the community’s goals and thinking strategically about how we can align those together, because that’s how the teachers gained support from their students and from the parents, is when they see that their interests are aligned. And as we do that, it’s easier to build public support. And you’re seeing those numbers of public approval of labor unions going up because of, I think unions are doing a better job at articulating just how the goals of collective bargaining of about staffing, health and safety, promotions, job security, investment decisions, all of that winds up being in the public interest, as well as in the interest of the workers, and now with the pandemic, health and safety issues. And in particular, we’re the canaries in the coal mine, and COVID is an occupational safety and health issue. Marc Steiner: So, I mean when you look at these 450 contracts coming up and the millions of workers that could be affected by this and families and people affected by this, but how is it they are rolling out, because so many public workers are not allowed to strike, you’ve got some really essential workers here that have their contracts coming up, how do you think it’s going to play out? I mean, given that the union leadership nationwide is what it is, at the very top, and you have a bunch of unions are kind of upstarts. As we talked about [inaudible 00:08:07], seven of them went with Bernie Sanders. So how do you see this playing out there, both in terms of the internal struggle inside unions and what the workers themselves can do facing these labor agreements in a time of a tight economy, plus this kind of COVID. I mean, how do you see all those forces playing together and acting out? Rand Wilson: So I think there’s a… You’ve mentioned a couple of different levels and each are kind of strategic. The most important actors in this drama will be the workers themselves. And, those workers are going to determine whether they’re going to fight back or concede to employer demands for austerity, are workers going to… And so union members ultimately make that decision with their level of involvement and their militancy is where that equation begins. And the union leaders have to respond to what the members want to do. In all of these agreements that are coming up in 2021, I can’t say where that’s going to happen, but those are the places where there’s an opportunity. And, if people begin to talk about their contract negotiations in a way that aligns it with the public good, as I talked about earlier, that’s going to draw the community into those talks. There’s no bar for a teachers’ union to bring students and parents to the negotiating table. There’s no bar for a private sector union to bring health and safety experts or community health, public health officials to the table, for the discussions about contractual issues. And by sort of opening up this process, there’s an opportunity to showcase what collective bargaining is all about. And if in fact, a struggle ensues, whether it’s informational picketing or rallies or public leafleting, or perhaps even a work stoppage, then if you’ve laid the groundwork, I think what we’re going to see is a very positive response from the community. And so… And there’s a political element to this as well, which is, if we open up the process and we’re more transparent about this, we can go to the elected officials at the community, state, federal level and say, “Hey, which side are you on? These people have been sacrificing during the pandemic. Are you going to side with corporate America? Or are you going to side with the workers in this struggle?” And by seeking that political support, we bring, as my co-author Peter Olney says, “We bring a political character to the struggle that’s incurring in these workplaces across America in 2021.” And so that’s why we call it a roadmap to the class struggle, but it’s ultimately the members that are going to decide. Marc Steiner: So I was thinking, as I have read your article, I was reading the other articles you wrote with him on the Amazon workers who are organizing around the country at this moment. So I have two questions here before we finished with each other. One has to do with just that. I mean, when you think about the world we’re entering into now, this digital age, and you have all these essentially warehouse workers in the digital industry in Alabama, California, New York, across the country, Chicago organizing, in what I termed earlier as it may be the new auto worker, steel workers of the 21st centuries in terms of where industry is going in America. And how do you see that playing out and being part of this? And can there be cross solidarity around this for workers at the Amazon workers… Let me just stop there. How do you think this is going to play out? Rand Wilson: Amazon is a behemoth. Amazon is the 21st century equivalent of auto and steel combined. And it’s a feature that is… It’s a platform that’s in thousands, millions of small businesses are relying on it. People rely on it now more than ever in the pandemic. And, you can call it a digital business, but it’s really not. It’s a logistics business. It’s no different than the combination of Sears and UPS. And there’s a huge tech workforce, that’s facilitating the innovation there. And there’s a huge warehouse and delivery workforce, that’s fulfilling the delivery of its product or the products that it’s the middleman for. It’s a logistics middleman between manufacturers, sellers and consumers. I’m hopeful. We’re seeing, really, an uprising among Amazon workers. And now in Bessemer, Alabama, actual representation elections going to take place by a mail ballot this month. So, I mean, at least we expect it to. And there’s a huge outpouring of support already for the workers in Bessemer, as there have been in Staten Island and in St. Paul and Sacramento and other places around the country where Amazon workers have stood up and fought back. So to me, regardless of the outcome of the election in Bessemer, the struggle of Amazon workers is something that all of us can come together around and support those workers. And, if you know somebody that works at Amazon, talk with them about joining a union and how they can play a meaningful role in transforming these jobs from the gig economy, essentially throw-away jobs, where people are disrespected to jobs where they rightfully make a decent wage and have a measure of job security and a future that they can believe in. Marc Steiner: And obviously what you just said, it actually is true. And probably that’s my last question here in our conversation today together. The Amazon drivers who drop off your, all your packages doing COVID, I have discovered in my conversations with them as they stop, and we talk across the yard that when you tell them that they support their union drive, their eyes light up. And I think the more workers see that people who are not in that union at that moment are supporting the work and believing that Amazon workers have a right to organize, that can change the nature of labor movement in this country, if they could win these struggles. I mean, this is critical. So I think that public supports you’re talking about for these workers, I mean, is part of the underpinning of the struggle. Rand Wilson: Absolutely. If we only have a few more minutes, it’s important to recognize that the federal government and the Biden administration, hopefully Congress will come together to recognize that the driver for Amazon, or for DoorDash or Lyft or Uber, they’re not contractors, they’re workers, they’re employees. They should not be second class citizens. And we need to be very clear with government, right now is the time to clarify for Amazon and for the gig economy employers, that they’re misclassifying these workers as contractors and our organizing efforts have to say, “No, you are an employee of Amazon. You’re going to be part of this union.” Because, say in Bessemer, it’s the warehouse workers that are organizing because they’re actually classified as employees of Amazon, but the drivers that are coming in and out of that Amazon facility, they’re labeled contractors and they’re being denied the right to organize, and they’re being denied the benefits of being an employee. Marc Steiner: So the very last thing is, I’ll let you go, and we will end this conversation, but you raised an issue. But at least for just a couple of minutes here, to respond to how you think the fight around the PRO Act, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which is going be coming before the house. And Democrats now control the Senate as well. Obama didn’t push a similar act when he was president, which I think helped them lose a lot. But, so what do you think that’s… I mean, how critical is that? [inaudible 00:18:02] this particular act could turn things over. It could change, it could stop the anti-labor legislation that has gone before it historically, how do you see that playing out? Rand Wilson: Well, we’ll have to bring a couple of Republicans over to our side to win that. And I’m not sure that the prospects are really that good. I feel like the momentum is beginning to swell in support, but honestly, I think if its not done at the executive level by President Biden, and I’m not that hopeful for passage of anything, until we get either rid of the filibuster or have a Congress in 2022 that’s prepared to pass pro-labor legislation. I don’t see it in a 50-50 Senate, with the filibuster. But what’s really encouraging to me is to see the public support for it, the political support, at least among Democrats and I’m just really hopeful that President Biden will say, “I want you to join a union.” Marc Steiner: That’d be critical. The struggle for that bill is important, whether it passes or not. This has been a great conversation Rand Wilson, I do appreciate you taking the time. I know you’re extremely busy and I look forward to many more conversations as we really support and explore the power of the union movement in our country. [inaudible 00:19:29] Rand Wilson: Thank you, Marc. Great to meet you. Marc Steiner: Been a pleasure. And I’m Marc Steiner here with The Real News Network. I’m glad you could join us. You see that scrolling across the bottom, mss@therealnews.com, please write to me. I want to hear about your labor struggles, your community struggles, what you’ve been fighting for, what is going on in your communities. We can talk about that together on the air and give us your sense of what you heard today. So please do that. So for The Real News Network, I’m Marc Steiner, thanks for joining us, and take care. With a new Democratic administration in place and so many union contracts about to expire, 2021 could be a major turning point in the labor movement. In this segment of “The Marc Steiner Show,” Marc is joined by longtime union organizer and Boston’s SEIU Local 888 Chief of Staff Rand Wilson to discuss how labor can seize this moment and turn 2021 into a year of mass solidarity.

      " Content: Charlie Cobb: The problem isn’t so much that a story that you read in a newspaper or that a news story that you see on television or hear on the radio is inaccurate on its face. It will tell you some little bit of who, what, when, where, and how. The problem is all the things that are left out.  Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. 40 years ago, I had the pleasure and the honor of meeting Charlie Cobb, who is a longtime activist in the civil rights movement and a worldwide journalist. 40 years ago, he came into the Maryland Penitentiary and he lectured 100 prisoners and interacted and talked to them. This is a followup interview 40 years later. Charlie Cobb, thank you for joining me.  Charlie Cobb: I’m glad to be here and good to see you again.  Eddie Conway: Okay. Now, Charlie, I just recently looked at the profound stuff you were saying and that can be found in connection to this interview. You had just come back from Rhodesia, and the world was changing, and basically, you were sharing with 100 prisoners that was giving you some pushback, too, what was going on around the world and why we didn’t know it. You want to talk about that experience, one, being in there, and two, how the world has changed since then? Charlie Cobb: Well, two things still remain with me. One is I wasn’t certain, since I think was aside from having been in jail myself as a part of the movement, this was kind of my first visit to a prison that was not associated really with civil rights struggle or freedom struggle. So I wasn’t certain what the exchange might be like. Then when I left, I remember telling myself that I think unexpectedly, quite frankly, that the discovery that it was possible to have frank and open and real discussion with people who were incarcerated stayed with me.  The second thing I remember about that visit 40 years ago was that since I was really in a prison, you’re going down these corridors, you’re getting checked, I had the real sense I’m going to meet men who are not just in prison, but in prison for a long time, and I was not going to a community center or a church or a school or something like that. But these were men whose whole life is defined by their imprisonment. Again, that’s different than my experience in the movement. Even if I was in jail for a month, my whole life was not defined by being in jail in Greenwood or Greenville, Mississippi, or Sunflower County, Mississippi. This was different. This was prison.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, well, one of the things is you talked about the world and its involvement and how things were going in Rhodesia, Mozambique, Iran, et cetera. How do you see the world today in reference to what you were saying 40 years ago? Charlie Cobb: We have a different, though related, set of problems today as compared to those years we’re talking about when I was visiting the prison. One, 40 years have passed. Nations are independent now that weren’t when I went to … I forget what year it was. I made three trips to Rhodesia, or Zimbabwe, as a journalist, and my first experience in that country, they were still fighting for liberation and freedom. It was not an independent nation. So I’m looking at a nation that’s struggling to be free and trying to figure out what they’re doing to gain that freedom. The second trip was … And this describes the passage of time. Second trip was immediately after Rhodesian independence, and Rhodesia now becomes Zimbabwe. So I’m looking at, “Well, what does it mean to be a brand new nation?” At that time, Zimbabwe was the newest nation on the African continent. So what does that mean? How do you … I have friends from Eritrea when they talked about gaining independence from Ethiopia said, “We’re starting from below zero.”  That’s sort of how it was. Well, what do you do? You’ve got all these guys, for instance, who fought as guerrillas for one of two organizations, ZAPU, Zimbabwe African People’s Union, or ZANU, the Zimbabwe African National Union. You had thousands of these guys that had been out in the bush, in many instances for years. So now they’re all coming back at the end of the war. They obviously all can’t be absorbed into a new national army. So what happens to them, and how do you grapple with that if you’re a brand new government, and, in a sense, learning how to be a government? That was my third trip to Zimbabwe, was that.  That’s been my experience. And I’ve been since then in other African nations. Eritrea, for instance, just won its independence from Ethiopia when I first went there. When I first went to Mozambique, it hadn’t been that long ago that they had gained their independence from Portugal. When I went to Angola, they had gained their independence, but South Africa had mounted an armed aggressive attack on this brand new … So I’m looking at these kinds of things, and they belong to a particular time period.  Now, today, if you go back to any of these places, it’s possible to measure where they’ve been successful and where they’ve failed. You’re really looking at countries, almost without exception, I will say, struggling under neocolonial pressures. In other words, their own governments are often being manipulated through outside forces, and they’re being forced to march in a particular independence. What I’ve learned in what might be called this post-independence period where I’ve been trying to keep up with African affairs, that just getting the flag of the colonialists lowered and raising your own flag of independence doesn’t solve a lot of problems, and even more complicated than fighting the Portuguese or the South Africans is now that we’ve raised our own flag, what do we do and how do we do it? I think we’re in some sort of era of transition as countries that are relatively new learn how to take control of their countries and of the industries and of the agriculture. I think we’re in some kind of transitional period, and they’re doing it under a great deal of pressure from forces outside of these countries. There have been, quite frankly, any number of natives of these countries who’ve betrayed their own country and facilitate what these outside forces are doing. That’s what I observe as I observe the places I went to before. New tyrannies grow up.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, one of the things that you talked about 40 years ago was the lack of awareness on the part of the American population because of the multinational media, the corporations. We don’t today hear about what’s going on in- Charlie Cobb: Yeah.  Eddie Conway: … the rest of the world, and it seems to be now that maybe six multinational corporations are controlling 85% of the major media outlets. Talk a little bit about the impact that today’s, and I’m not even thinking about Trump, but today’s news media is having on the American population and their consciousness.  Charlie Cobb: It’s interesting. I mean one, first, Americans still don’t have much interest in the rest of the world. They consider what the rest of the world needs as being an inconvenience to the life they want to live. Media doesn’t help with this. We still don’t get much when we talk about Africa, Asia, Latin America. We still don’t get much insight from media in the dynamic of the world. Media is about money, and that’s all you need to understand about media. It’s about what works in the way of making money. Media is also ideological, I think. It’s funny. The way … People don’t understand this about media. It’s really what’s left out that defines news media and not so much any bias by news media.  Here’s a story, for instance. This is from way back, and it’s not international. The New York Times travel section did a story many years ago. It was a travel piece, and it was a travel piece about Atlanta, Georgia. The writer goes as a part of doing this piece and he writes about going to Lester … Oh, what is his last name now? Former governor.  Eddie Conway: Maddox? Charlie Cobb: Yes. He goes … At that point, he’s not governor. He’s running a souvenir shop in Atlanta, right, not very far from the University of Georgia. What the writer finds enchanting and writes about it glowingly is that this guy, a notorious racist who beat up students in Atlanta who were trying to desegregate his restaurant with ax handles, and that he’s selling in his souvenir shop ax handles with no reference to how he used those ax handles in the 60s against Black students protesting. If you didn’t know that, you’d have no idea about what the truth really is. I mean, it’s what left out. You have to know, and I happened to have been in Atlanta when this was happening. You had to know that here was a racist guy, former governor now, who campaigned on a racist platform, now running a souvenir shop in which he’s selling replicas of ax handles that he used to beat up Black students.  That’s where your problem with media is, whether it’s that situation in Atlanta or whether it’s someplace in Africa. What’s left out determines how the story is perceived by the public. What’s left out of a lot of media is Africa. So Africa is not very important to the public. It’s not … If you see something that’s really biased, you can recognize it and respond to it. That’s your basic problem with news media.  The other problem with news media is it’s driven by entertainment values. Does anybody really think that somebody who reads the news every night as the anchors on television networks do is worth millions of dollars of pay? A half an hour news show is 23 minutes. I think news anchors get anywhere from $2-3 million a year in salaries. Why? What’s at play is entertainment value. It’s just the same way a Hollywood star or actor gets all those big bucks. So entertainment values drive news media. I live in Jacksonville, Florida, where news reporting is awful down here, and what drives it on television is the entertainment value of what they show, the pictures. Sometimes they’ll give two or three minutes to something that you think might be worth 30 seconds.  So this is a huge problem. And I used to say one way around it is let’s make Black newspapers really relevant to generating the news. I never had much success with that, and it’s another kind of problem, because all students in journalism schools for the most part want to be in network news, because that’s where the money is. I understand. I understand that, but the public doesn’t really have a sense of what’s happening with the news. The founder, the producer, the original producer of 60 Minutes, said in an interview once the secret to the success of 60 Minutes was that show’s ability to combine entertainment with newsgathering, and that what was really driving 60 Minutes was entertainment values.  I mean, you think about it. It was 60 Minutes that pioneered the ambush interview, for instance. You show up with a camera crew and you knock on the door and somebody you want to charge with something as a reporter. The real reason for doing that is not to find out any information, but it’s entertaining to see these cameras stalking somebody up the street or hiding in their house and whatnot. We see this all over the place.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, let’s change tacks for one minute. You mentioned the civil rights movement and nonviolence. And even then, the prisoners had an interest in that. Some years later, a few years ago, you wrote a book, “This Nonviolent Stuff Will Get You Killed.” Can you talk a little bit about that book and why you wrote it? Charlie Cobb: Yeah. For years, I’ve always tried to push the idea that what really drove the movement was grassroots community organizing in the rural South. That’s what I think, as opposed to mass protests in public spaces led by charismatic leaders. Martin Luther King is a great example of the charismatic leader. I think it was the work at the grassroots, and that’s what we did in SNCC. We dug in to these rural communities to organize, to get people to see their own potential, to get people to take control of their own lives or at least fight to take control of their own lives. That’s what we were about.  Now, if you worked in the rural South, certainly in the 60s, and I think it would be true today, one, it was very violent, and two, guns were everywhere. Black people had guns. White people had guns. Self-defense was routine. I’ve been in a room … I’m thinking of some old men I was in a room with and they were all cleaning their rifles and talking about how they were part of the nonviolent movement. I’ve had guys tell me, they would say something like, “You may be nonviolent, Charlie, but I’m not going to let these white people kill you.” So there’s that whole layer of [inaudible 00:20:05] that has to do with self-defense and the possession of arms. A lot of the reason for that is because a lot of the guys, older men who supported us and gave us support, and older women for that matter, but older men, a lot of them were World War II veterans and Korean War veterans. They had been trained to shoot and didn’t hesitate to shoot back.  There’s a whole story I was trying to tell. It was really two stories. One was the story of organizing at the grassroots. Secondly, it was the story of guns in the South, which I simply felt was an under-told story, the storyteller in me found that. The very title of the book, which is “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible” is taken from a Black farmer in Mississippi, Hartman Turnbow, legendary figure in Mississippi, but omitted from the history. When the Night Riders attacked his home because of his support for the movement, he drove them away with his Winchester rifle. When we showed up the next morning, the first thing out of his mouth when he saw us was, “I wasn’t being non-nonviolent. I was just protecting my family.”  He met Martin Luther King once, ’64. He was introduced to Martin Luther King. And Mr. Turnbow, who was 60-something, Mr. Turnbow never shy to speak his mind after the formalities of introduction, looked at Reverend King and said, “Reverend King, this nonviolent stuff ain’t no good. It’s going to get you killed one day.” Tragically, that’s exactly what happened, but that was too long a quote for a book title. So I just shrank it down to “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed.” But the point … But it’s taken from the words and wisdom of a much older man than I was. Again, the book I did about guns tries to project the voices of the people we work with as organizers at the grassroots.  I think although it’s beginning to change a little bit, I think the movement story, the real movement story, is poorly told. I think part of that has to do with the nature of academia and part of that has to do with who’s permitted to speak, who’s permitted to publish. There’s a whole … It’s limited if you want to get real voices.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, that brings me to the next question, then, because I understand you’re working on a book now. What is this book addressing? Charlie Cobb: This book is called, the title is called “Get in the Way: Protests, Politics, and the Movement for Black Lives.” You probably won’t be surprised that when those of us who are veterans of the movement, particularly grassroots organizers, look at today’s young activists, we see a lot of ourselves in them and we try and give them support. We make statements in support of them. We have a SNCC legacy project, and we have a lot of meetings, and we always involve today’s young activists. Before this COVID-19 virus, or what I call the Trump virus, hit this country, we were planning for commemorating the 60th anniversary of the formation of SNCC, and it was going to be an intergenerational conference so that it wouldn’t just say, “This is what we did in 1961 or ’62, or whatnot.” It was going to be a real conversation and interaction between this millennial generation and us who are war babies and baby boomer generation 50 years ago. Almost all of us that were involved, we just finished celebrating the 80th birthday of a friend of ours in SNCC. We’re going to try and do it virtually now, but it’s a different dynamic when you talk about a virtual conference. I think projecting … You can see what we do if you look at the SNCC digital gateway which we organized. That’s snccdigital.org. We collaborated with Duke University to generate this digital gateway. When we had, not a draft, but whatever the equivalent of a draft is virtually, we asked a number of young activists to comment on it. We wanted to know whether they thought it was helpful for what they were trying to do. We wanted to know what they thought of it as storytelling about this period of time that we were involved in. Without exception, they all said, “Well, we just don’t hear our voices in this. We don’t hear … This site doesn’t tell what we think of people like Fannie Lou Hamer or Ella Baker.”  So this being the age of technology, we asked them. And this is how our relationship goes with these young activists. This being the age of technology, we asked them to use their cell phone and record a video of themselves talking about what the site helped them with or didn’t help them with. So now if you click onto the site, you’ll find a whole section devoted to the voices of the young activists today. Things aren’t the same now as they were back in 1961 when I came to Mississippi, but they find they want to know, “Well what was Mrs. Hamer really like, Charlie? Tell us about Ella Baker,” that sort of thing. We think this is one of the most important developments that has emerged in this early part of the 21st century and go out of our way to include them in our conversations and go out of our way to try and …  And we don’t always agree on everything. They resisted the idea … This was early on in our relationship. They thought campaigning in elections, for instance, or choosing candidate support was selling out to the establishment. We said we had the same arguments and it took us a while to see. And what turned around our thinking, we had long conversations with them about that. So we don’t always agree on everything they say, but it’s their movement, and we make it clear we’re always open to telling you—we’ll never not tell you what we think about anything you’re doing, but it’s your movement. We’re around to support it, to lend you whatever you need from our experience, and to make sure the public knows that we think that what you’re doing is valuable.  Eddie Conway: Well, Charlie, tell me this then. Right now today, post-Trump, whatever, the virus here, the George Floyd—the movement itself, where do you think we are today, and how do you think we’re going to go forward? I know you say it’s their movement, but if you look at it now from 10,000 feet, what do you see? Charlie Cobb: Well it depends on what day you catch me on.  Eddie Conway: Okay. Let’s try today.  Charlie Cobb: I mean I go back and forth on that. I worry a lot-  Eddie Conway: Okay.  Charlie Cobb: … about the direction the country’s going on. See, I think it’s a mistake to use Donald Trump as the signpost for where the country is going. I think this goes … What’s unfolding runs deeper than Donald Trump. This whole trend toward authoritarian rule, this whole trend towards disenfranchising Black and Brown people, began before Trump, and not much of it has stopped since he lost the election. What Trump was able to do was provide fascist forces a way to coalesce in and around being against immigrants, being against Black people, being against Brown people, and he did facilitate that. I tell people it’s as if the head of the White Citizens’ Council became the President of the United States. If you remove the head of the White Citizens’ Council, it doesn’t mean all the themes that the Citizens’ Council was about have vanished.  So I don’t know what that’s going to mean. I mean, certainly when I look at the political scene today, say at the White House or Washington, I can already see what these extreme right-wing forces are throwing up to prevent Biden from being able to do very much. I listen to the apologies, not the apologies but the excuses, being made for all these people who stormed the White House, stormed the Capitol, flying Confederate flags and all of this. What does that mean for the long term? Yeah. What does that represent? Remember, Trump, he lost the election, but he also gained 70 million votes. What will that mean for my grandkids? I have five grandkids. What will that mean for those kids down the road? It’s not at all clear.  If anything, what has really been striking is the cowardice of the political leadership of this country and the media. It took the media over two years just to call Trump a liar. I remember those arguments that they were having. “Well, should we call the president a liar?” The cowardice in the political establishment to me is striking. What does that mean when you get right down to it? Does it take men in jackboots kicking in your door before you realize you’ve got a problem? So I’m ambivalent in the sense of not being able to speak precisely on what it means. I think when you catch me on a real bad day, the trend is toward totalitarianism and authoritarianism. That’s what I really see on my worst days. On a good day, I look at the Movement for Black Lives, say, “Well, how will they come out on this? Will this continue the fight? Are they able to sustain the fight?” As I told you, I come out of an organizing tradition. And one of the conversations I and others at SNCC in particular have with today’s young activists is about protest is necessary, we say, but it’s not sufficient. You have to sustain a movement. You have to figure out how best to organize for change, how to speak to communities, how to speak to neighborhoods, how to put neighborhoods in the trenches with you. It’s sort of in some ways seems to me to be a new idea to them, and I understand it, because we had the same problem with our own evolution. All of us, myself, Stokely, all of us, came out of the sit-in movement, the nonviolent protest movement which we challenged segregation and white supremacy. Ms. Baker was encouraging us to think about organizing at the grassroots, but it was slow for us to come to that kind of understanding of the necessity.  Ironically, because I was 19 years old when I went to Mississippi, for our age group, it was the older people who took us by the hand and said, “Let us show you what we really need and let us introduce you to the people,” all of them older than we were, “who will help you fight with us to get what we really need.”  Eddie Conway: Charlie, not to cut you off, but that brings me to a point, because after the civil rights movement, obviously there was the Black Power movement that grew out of the civil rights movement, in fact, and then the Black Liberation movement, and now we have massive incarceration of millions of people, Black, Brown bodies, et cetera. Are we any better off now we went through all those processes- Charlie Cobb: Yeah.  Eddie Conway: … than we were then and why? Charlie Cobb: I think, one, I think I don’t … See, I see Black struggle as a continuous struggle with ups and downs since slavery, since the enslavement of Black people. So it takes on various qualities and characteristics over time, but it’s a mistake to talk about the civil rights era and the Black Power era and the whatever, because it’s not that. Black struggle in this country goes … And I tell people all the time, “Look, enslaved Africans were not marching in nonviolent protests on auction blocks. Enslaved Africans were not having sit-ins in plantation manor dining rooms.” What were they doing? Well, they were doing the best they could to fight to make life better. Sometimes that involved escape. Sometimes that involved rebellion. Sometimes that involved secret schools. Sometimes that included assassination. It included sabotage. It included … I mean, people pick the tactics and strategies they want to use in terms of the time period that they’re in. Slavery was abolished in 1863, so we don’t have slave rebellions anymore, but just because slavery was abolished through the Emancipation Proclamation, at least in the Confederate states, just because slavery didn’t mean that white supremacy and racism was eliminated. And Black people knew that, even if white people didn’t. They picked the weapons they felt necessary to fight it. So like I say, what we were doing in the 60s was using the weapons we thought best to fight white supremacy. The Movement for Black Lives will pick—not all their weapons are going to be the same as ours, and that’s okay. It’s all …  [inaudible 00:38:29] Mozambique [foreign language 00:38:30], the struggle continues. You make incremental progress. I don’t have a vision of a grand revolutionary change that emancipates everybody. I think it’s just a fact of life. You make evolutionary progress. Sometimes that’s a setback. For instance, take the Supreme Court. You could say, and I know people who have said this, older, you could say that Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice represents progress. Not something I would say, but I know people who would say that. So sometimes what you think of progress turns out not to be progress. Sometimes what you hadn’t thought of as being particularly significant turns out to be significant.  In the framework of Black struggle, people like me try and commit younger people to what I think is progressive struggle, but be clear, it’s what I think, and I’m not the gospel. I’m one guy living in this world, and I will tell you what I think is progressive, I will tell you what I think is reactionary, I’ll tell you why I think that or why I don’t think that, but the struggle continues. This current surge of youthful activism proves that, it seems to me, makes it inarguable that struggle continues. I’m 77, and I got off the phone yesterday with a guy just turned 22. I remember telling him, “You mean you’re old enough now for me to take you out for a drink or beer or something?” But he’s very active in North Carolina in struggle. I’m sure you’ve seen that in Baltimore and other places, because I imagine you had conversations with some of these young activists. I consider that progress, even if all the questions that need to be answered haven’t been answered. It’s progress that we have yet another generation that’s continuing to struggle. Then I realize … Of course, I’m writing about the Movement for Black Lives, now. The title, by the way, came from John Lewis, “Get in the Way.” It was one of his standard lines speaking to college students. “You see something wrong or you see something unfair, et cetera, et cetera, don’t be afraid. Get in the way. Stand up.” I took the line from John. So I realize because I just typed that John Lewis quote that there’s an even younger generation behind the millennials who are becoming active in the movement. These are the kids who are high school students, freshmen in college if they’re going to college, but they are 17, 18. Alicia Garza, whom I like a lot, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, is almost 40. While she’s young to me because I’m 77, even Derrick Johnson, the head of the NAACP, is 51. And I told him, because I know Derrick from when he was at [inaudible 00:42:44], “You’re young to me.” He wanted to know why I was interviewing him if I was doing a book about young activists. I said, “Aside from your role as head of the NAACP,” he was 50 when I interviewed him, “you just told me you turned 50. That makes you young to me.”  So there’s some flexibility in what we mean when we say young activists, but I don’t worry so much as long as I see young people in motion for change. I’m less worried about the future than when I see the kind of cowardice I see in newsrooms and the national legislature, the Congress or the White House. As long as I see meaningful young activism, it sort of renews my hope and it renews my faith in what’s possible in the way of change. The country has changed in some ways. I mean, one of the striking things about the round of demonstrations that began with the acquittal of George Zimmerman of the murder of Trayvon Martin, one of the things that striking to me, as somebody who remembers the 50s and 60s, is how diverse the protesters are, and also that these protests are international.  That’s really different than my experience in the 60s, and I find that a progressive change. I mean, you can go … I live in Jacksonville, Florida, north Florida, perhaps where the Ku Klux Klan is strongest, but you can go into white neighborhoods and see Black Lives Matter signs. That just didn’t happen, at least in my day. It just didn’t happen. Whatever comes of that, I say it reflects a kind of progress in the consciousness of the country, although there are powerful forces, and I don’t think people understand how powerful these forces are, working against this kind of change. When I say … I don’t mean by that saying Kamala Harris represents progressive change. I don’t know. I don’t know the lady. I really don’t know much about her politics, but I do know what I see on the street in the sense of the kind of activism that’s been unfolding for a decade now. I’ve had the opportunity, happily, to talk to them, because they’re interested in the experiences of people like me.  They might not know very much about SNCC, or CORE, or Ella Baker, or Fannie Lou Hamer, or Stokely Carmichael, but they’re interested in that. And they’re interested because they’re looking for things that they can use. When I was their age, civil rights struggle, until we sort of fell into it, was considered something grownups did. I never saw myself until the sit-ins happened in 1960, and then I’m looking at people like me, Diane Nash, and John Lewis, and a whole bunch of people, Julian Bond. They looked like me, and they were my age, and whatnot. So I consider this progress, all of this, and to the extent that it’s possible to retain some belief that the country will pull out of this stuff that Donald Trump and others have led … Although it goes back, much further back. And people forget the Southern Negro Youth Congress, which was formed in the 1930s, was destroyed by the McCarthy era tyrannies in the 1950s.  So this is not new, this stuff that Donald Trump is putting forth, and he plays to the lowest common denominators. So when you think of it that way, you think of this long struggle that’s both ahead of you and that has flourished behind you, and just being able to survive is hopeful.  Eddie Conway: So we’re going to end this on do you have any final thoughts that you’d like to share with older activists, as well as younger activists in terms of working together or- Charlie Cobb: Well, I think that- Eddie Conway: … moving forward? Charlie Cobb: I think the most important thing we older activists can do is to interact with today’s young activists. It doesn’t mean we have to be out on the street with them. That’ll depend on a lot of stuff, including health, but I think that experience that all of us have had, whether it’s SNCC, CORE, the Black Panther Party, all that stuff that we’ve experienced, we ought to share it, consciously share it, and consciously figure out ways to pass it on. It doesn’t mean they’re going to accept everything we say, but if you work hard to develop the right relationship with these young activists, they will not simply listen, but they’ll think about what you’re sharing with it and they’ll discard what they don’t need and they will use what they need. That’s a valuable thing if you’re to do … I’ve been a little disturbed at the distance so-called Black leaders take with regard to these young activists.  I can remember—this was some years back on one of the anniversaries of the March on Washington—when young activists were denied access to the stage by the civil rights establishment. That’s some wrong approach. I think Andy Young once called something they were doing stupid. You may disagree with some of the things that today’s young activists do, but stupid they’re not, and stupid shuts the door in their face. That’s stupid. We ought to give them a lot more support than they get. Here, I’m talking about the older people who reflect the leadership establishment in the Black community. It’s really important to do that and to demonstrate that, insofar as you’re concerned, what they’re doing is legitimate and necessary.  Eddie Conway: Okay, Charlie. Thank you. Thank you for that insight.  Charlie Cobb: Thank you. Eddie Conway: Thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. In 1980, Eddie Conway participated in and helped organize a prisoners’ educational outreach program called “To Say Their Own Words,” where thinkers and scholars came to Maryland Penitentiary and spoke about topics like impending U.S. fascism, the prison-industrial complex, capitalism, increased surveillance, and many other issues that have become even more pressing today. These speakers included Amiri Baraka, Askia Muhammad, Bruce Franklin, Nijole Benokraitis, and Charlie Cobb. As part of an ongoing series for TRNN’s Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway speaks with these individuals about their predictions in 1980 and how they resonate today. This interview is with longtime civil rights activist, journalist, and author of “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed,” Charlie Cobb. In this speech, delivered to Maryland Penitentiary prisoners in 1980, journalist and civil rights activist Charlie Cobb discusses his experiences reporting in Rhodesia and the U.S., and explains how the news industry’s interests influence people’s understanding of themselves and the world. \n",

It will tell you some little bit of who, what, when, where, and how. The problem is all the things that are left out.  Eddie Conway: Welcome to this episode of Rattling the Bars. 40 years ago, I had the pleasure and the honor of meeting Charlie Cobb, who is a longtime activist in the civil rights movement and a worldwide journalist. 40 years ago, he came into the Maryland Penitentiary and he lectured 100 prisoners and interacted and talked to them. This is a followup interview 40 years later. Charlie Cobb, thank you for joining me.  Charlie Cobb: I’m glad to be here and good to see you again.  Eddie Conway: Okay. Now, Charlie, I just recently looked at the profound stuff you were saying and that can be found in connection to this interview. You had just come back from Rhodesia, and the world was changing, and basically, you were sharing with 100 prisoners that was giving you some pushback, too, what was going on around the world and why we didn’t know it. You want to talk about that experience, one, being in there, and two, how the world has changed since then? Charlie Cobb: Well, two things still remain with me. One is I wasn’t certain, since I think was aside from having been in jail myself as a part of the movement, this was kind of my first visit to a prison that was not associated really with civil rights struggle or freedom struggle. So I wasn’t certain what the exchange might be like. Then when I left, I remember telling myself that I think unexpectedly, quite frankly, that the discovery that it was possible to have frank and open and real discussion with people who were incarcerated stayed with me.  The second thing I remember about that visit 40 years ago was that since I was really in a prison, you’re going down these corridors, you’re getting checked, I had the real sense I’m going to meet men who are not just in prison, but in prison for a long time, and I was not going to a community center or a church or a school or something like that. But these were men whose whole life is defined by their imprisonment. Again, that’s different than my experience in the movement. Even if I was in jail for a month, my whole life was not defined by being in jail in Greenwood or Greenville, Mississippi, or Sunflower County, Mississippi. This was different. This was prison.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, well, one of the things is you talked about the world and its involvement and how things were going in Rhodesia, Mozambique, Iran, et cetera. How do you see the world today in reference to what you were saying 40 years ago? Charlie Cobb: We have a different, though related, set of problems today as compared to those years we’re talking about when I was visiting the prison. One, 40 years have passed. Nations are independent now that weren’t when I went to … I forget what year it was. I made three trips to Rhodesia, or Zimbabwe, as a journalist, and my first experience in that country, they were still fighting for liberation and freedom. It was not an independent nation. So I’m looking at a nation that’s struggling to be free and trying to figure out what they’re doing to gain that freedom. The second trip was … And this describes the passage of time. Second trip was immediately after Rhodesian independence, and Rhodesia now becomes Zimbabwe. So I’m looking at, “Well, what does it mean to be a brand new nation?” At that time, Zimbabwe was the newest nation on the African continent. So what does that mean? How do you … I have friends from Eritrea when they talked about gaining independence from Ethiopia said, “We’re starting from below zero.”  That’s sort of how it was. Well, what do you do? You’ve got all these guys, for instance, who fought as guerrillas for one of two organizations, ZAPU, Zimbabwe African People’s Union, or ZANU, the Zimbabwe African National Union. You had thousands of these guys that had been out in the bush, in many instances for years. So now they’re all coming back at the end of the war. They obviously all can’t be absorbed into a new national army. So what happens to them, and how do you grapple with that if you’re a brand new government, and, in a sense, learning how to be a government? That was my third trip to Zimbabwe, was that.  That’s been my experience. And I’ve been since then in other African nations. Eritrea, for instance, just won its independence from Ethiopia when I first went there. When I first went to Mozambique, it hadn’t been that long ago that they had gained their independence from Portugal. When I went to Angola, they had gained their independence, but South Africa had mounted an armed aggressive attack on this brand new … So I’m looking at these kinds of things, and they belong to a particular time period.  Now, today, if you go back to any of these places, it’s possible to measure where they’ve been successful and where they’ve failed. You’re really looking at countries, almost without exception, I will say, struggling under neocolonial pressures. In other words, their own governments are often being manipulated through outside forces, and they’re being forced to march in a particular independence. What I’ve learned in what might be called this post-independence period where I’ve been trying to keep up with African affairs, that just getting the flag of the colonialists lowered and raising your own flag of independence doesn’t solve a lot of problems, and even more complicated than fighting the Portuguese or the South Africans is now that we’ve raised our own flag, what do we do and how do we do it? I think we’re in some sort of era of transition as countries that are relatively new learn how to take control of their countries and of the industries and of the agriculture. I think we’re in some kind of transitional period, and they’re doing it under a great deal of pressure from forces outside of these countries. There have been, quite frankly, any number of natives of these countries who’ve betrayed their own country and facilitate what these outside forces are doing. That’s what I observe as I observe the places I went to before. New tyrannies grow up.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, one of the things that you talked about 40 years ago was the lack of awareness on the part of the American population because of the multinational media, the corporations. We don’t today hear about what’s going on in- Charlie Cobb: Yeah.  Eddie Conway: … the rest of the world, and it seems to be now that maybe six multinational corporations are controlling 85% of the major media outlets. Talk a little bit about the impact that today’s, and I’m not even thinking about Trump, but today’s news media is having on the American population and their consciousness.  Charlie Cobb: It’s interesting. I mean one, first, Americans still don’t have much interest in the rest of the world. They consider what the rest of the world needs as being an inconvenience to the life they want to live. Media doesn’t help with this. We still don’t get much when we talk about Africa, Asia, Latin America. We still don’t get much insight from media in the dynamic of the world. Media is about money, and that’s all you need to understand about media. It’s about what works in the way of making money. Media is also ideological, I think. It’s funny. The way … People don’t understand this about media. It’s really what’s left out that defines news media and not so much any bias by news media.  Here’s a story, for instance. This is from way back, and it’s not international. The New York Times travel section did a story many years ago. It was a travel piece, and it was a travel piece about Atlanta, Georgia. The writer goes as a part of doing this piece and he writes about going to Lester … Oh, what is his last name now? Former governor.  Eddie Conway: Maddox? Charlie Cobb: Yes. He goes … At that point, he’s not governor. He’s running a souvenir shop in Atlanta, right, not very far from the University of Georgia. What the writer finds enchanting and writes about it glowingly is that this guy, a notorious racist who beat up students in Atlanta who were trying to desegregate his restaurant with ax handles, and that he’s selling in his souvenir shop ax handles with no reference to how he used those ax handles in the 60s against Black students protesting. If you didn’t know that, you’d have no idea about what the truth really is. I mean, it’s what left out. You have to know, and I happened to have been in Atlanta when this was happening. You had to know that here was a racist guy, former governor now, who campaigned on a racist platform, now running a souvenir shop in which he’s selling replicas of ax handles that he used to beat up Black students.  That’s where your problem with media is, whether it’s that situation in Atlanta or whether it’s someplace in Africa. What’s left out determines how the story is perceived by the public. What’s left out of a lot of media is Africa. So Africa is not very important to the public. It’s not … If you see something that’s really biased, you can recognize it and respond to it. That’s your basic problem with news media.  The other problem with news media is it’s driven by entertainment values. Does anybody really think that somebody who reads the news every night as the anchors on television networks do is worth millions of dollars of pay? A half an hour news show is 23 minutes. I think news anchors get anywhere from $2-3 million a year in salaries. Why? What’s at play is entertainment value. It’s just the same way a Hollywood star or actor gets all those big bucks. So entertainment values drive news media. I live in Jacksonville, Florida, where news reporting is awful down here, and what drives it on television is the entertainment value of what they show, the pictures. Sometimes they’ll give two or three minutes to something that you think might be worth 30 seconds.  So this is a huge problem. And I used to say one way around it is let’s make Black newspapers really relevant to generating the news. I never had much success with that, and it’s another kind of problem, because all students in journalism schools for the most part want to be in network news, because that’s where the money is. I understand. I understand that, but the public doesn’t really have a sense of what’s happening with the news. The founder, the producer, the original producer of 60 Minutes, said in an interview once the secret to the success of 60 Minutes was that show’s ability to combine entertainment with newsgathering, and that what was really driving 60 Minutes was entertainment values.  I mean, you think about it. It was 60 Minutes that pioneered the ambush interview, for instance. You show up with a camera crew and you knock on the door and somebody you want to charge with something as a reporter. The real reason for doing that is not to find out any information, but it’s entertaining to see these cameras stalking somebody up the street or hiding in their house and whatnot. We see this all over the place.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, let’s change tacks for one minute. You mentioned the civil rights movement and nonviolence. And even then, the prisoners had an interest in that. Some years later, a few years ago, you wrote a book, “This Nonviolent Stuff Will Get You Killed.” Can you talk a little bit about that book and why you wrote it? Charlie Cobb: Yeah. For years, I’ve always tried to push the idea that what really drove the movement was grassroots community organizing in the rural South. That’s what I think, as opposed to mass protests in public spaces led by charismatic leaders. Martin Luther King is a great example of the charismatic leader. I think it was the work at the grassroots, and that’s what we did in SNCC. We dug in to these rural communities to organize, to get people to see their own potential, to get people to take control of their own lives or at least fight to take control of their own lives. That’s what we were about.  Now, if you worked in the rural South, certainly in the 60s, and I think it would be true today, one, it was very violent, and two, guns were everywhere. Black people had guns. White people had guns. Self-defense was routine. I’ve been in a room … I’m thinking of some old men I was in a room with and they were all cleaning their rifles and talking about how they were part of the nonviolent movement. I’ve had guys tell me, they would say something like, “You may be nonviolent, Charlie, but I’m not going to let these white people kill you.” So there’s that whole layer of [inaudible 00:20:05] that has to do with self-defense and the possession of arms. A lot of the reason for that is because a lot of the guys, older men who supported us and gave us support, and older women for that matter, but older men, a lot of them were World War II veterans and Korean War veterans. They had been trained to shoot and didn’t hesitate to shoot back.  There’s a whole story I was trying to tell. It was really two stories. One was the story of organizing at the grassroots. Secondly, it was the story of guns in the South, which I simply felt was an under-told story, the storyteller in me found that. The very title of the book, which is “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible” is taken from a Black farmer in Mississippi, Hartman Turnbow, legendary figure in Mississippi, but omitted from the history. When the Night Riders attacked his home because of his support for the movement, he drove them away with his Winchester rifle. When we showed up the next morning, the first thing out of his mouth when he saw us was, “I wasn’t being non-nonviolent. I was just protecting my family.”  He met Martin Luther King once, ’64. He was introduced to Martin Luther King. And Mr. Turnbow, who was 60-something, Mr. Turnbow never shy to speak his mind after the formalities of introduction, looked at Reverend King and said, “Reverend King, this nonviolent stuff ain’t no good. It’s going to get you killed one day.” Tragically, that’s exactly what happened, but that was too long a quote for a book title. So I just shrank it down to “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed.” But the point … But it’s taken from the words and wisdom of a much older man than I was. Again, the book I did about guns tries to project the voices of the people we work with as organizers at the grassroots.  I think although it’s beginning to change a little bit, I think the movement story, the real movement story, is poorly told. I think part of that has to do with the nature of academia and part of that has to do with who’s permitted to speak, who’s permitted to publish. There’s a whole … It’s limited if you want to get real voices.  Eddie Conway: Charlie, that brings me to the next question, then, because I understand you’re working on a book now. What is this book addressing? Charlie Cobb: This book is called, the title is called “Get in the Way: Protests, Politics, and the Movement for Black Lives.” You probably won’t be surprised that when those of us who are veterans of the movement, particularly grassroots organizers, look at today’s young activists, we see a lot of ourselves in them and we try and give them support. We make statements in support of them. We have a SNCC legacy project, and we have a lot of meetings, and we always involve today’s young activists. Before this COVID-19 virus, or what I call the Trump virus, hit this country, we were planning for commemorating the 60th anniversary of the formation of SNCC, and it was going to be an intergenerational conference so that it wouldn’t just say, “This is what we did in 1961 or ’62, or whatnot.” It was going to be a real conversation and interaction between this millennial generation and us who are war babies and baby boomer generation 50 years ago. Almost all of us that were involved, we just finished celebrating the 80th birthday of a friend of ours in SNCC. We’re going to try and do it virtually now, but it’s a different dynamic when you talk about a virtual conference. I think projecting … You can see what we do if you look at the SNCC digital gateway which we organized. That’s snccdigital.org. We collaborated with Duke University to generate this digital gateway. When we had, not a draft, but whatever the equivalent of a draft is virtually, we asked a number of young activists to comment on it. We wanted to know whether they thought it was helpful for what they were trying to do. We wanted to know what they thought of it as storytelling about this period of time that we were involved in. Without exception, they all said, “Well, we just don’t hear our voices in this. We don’t hear … This site doesn’t tell what we think of people like Fannie Lou Hamer or Ella Baker.”  So this being the age of technology, we asked them. And this is how our relationship goes with these young activists. This being the age of technology, we asked them to use their cell phone and record a video of themselves talking about what the site helped them with or didn’t help them with. So now if you click onto the site, you’ll find a whole section devoted to the voices of the young activists today. Things aren’t the same now as they were back in 1961 when I came to Mississippi, but they find they want to know, “Well what was Mrs. Hamer really like, Charlie? Tell us about Ella Baker,” that sort of thing. We think this is one of the most important developments that has emerged in this early part of the 21st century and go out of our way to include them in our conversations and go out of our way to try and …  And we don’t always agree on everything. They resisted the idea … This was early on in our relationship. They thought campaigning in elections, for instance, or choosing candidate support was selling out to the establishment. We said we had the same arguments and it took us a while to see. And what turned around our thinking, we had long conversations with them about that. So we don’t always agree on everything they say, but it’s their movement, and we make it clear we’re always open to telling you—we’ll never not tell you what we think about anything you’re doing, but it’s your movement. We’re around to support it, to lend you whatever you need from our experience, and to make sure the public knows that we think that what you’re doing is valuable.  Eddie Conway: Well, Charlie, tell me this then. Right now today, post-Trump, whatever, the virus here, the George Floyd—the movement itself, where do you think we are today, and how do you think we’re going to go forward? I know you say it’s their movement, but if you look at it now from 10,000 feet, what do you see? Charlie Cobb: Well it depends on what day you catch me on.  Eddie Conway: Okay. Let’s try today.  Charlie Cobb: I mean I go back and forth on that. I worry a lot-  Eddie Conway: Okay.  Charlie Cobb: … about the direction the country’s going on. See, I think it’s a mistake to use Donald Trump as the signpost for where the country is going. I think this goes … What’s unfolding runs deeper than Donald Trump. This whole trend toward authoritarian rule, this whole trend towards disenfranchising Black and Brown people, began before Trump, and not much of it has stopped since he lost the election. What Trump was able to do was provide fascist forces a way to coalesce in and around being against immigrants, being against Black people, being against Brown people, and he did facilitate that. I tell people it’s as if the head of the White Citizens’ Council became the President of the United States. If you remove the head of the White Citizens’ Council, it doesn’t mean all the themes that the Citizens’ Council was about have vanished.  So I don’t know what that’s going to mean. I mean, certainly when I look at the political scene today, say at the White House or Washington, I can already see what these extreme right-wing forces are throwing up to prevent Biden from being able to do very much. I listen to the apologies, not the apologies but the excuses, being made for all these people who stormed the White House, stormed the Capitol, flying Confederate flags and all of this. What does that mean for the long term? Yeah. What does that represent? Remember, Trump, he lost the election, but he also gained 70 million votes. What will that mean for my grandkids? I have five grandkids. What will that mean for those kids down the road? It’s not at all clear.  If anything, what has really been striking is the cowardice of the political leadership of this country and the media. It took the media over two years just to call Trump a liar. I remember those arguments that they were having. “Well, should we call the president a liar?” The cowardice in the political establishment to me is striking. What does that mean when you get right down to it? Does it take men in jackboots kicking in your door before you realize you’ve got a problem? So I’m ambivalent in the sense of not being able to speak precisely on what it means. I think when you catch me on a real bad day, the trend is toward totalitarianism and authoritarianism. That’s what I really see on my worst days. On a good day, I look at the Movement for Black Lives, say, “Well, how will they come out on this? Will this continue the fight? Are they able to sustain the fight?” As I told you, I come out of an organizing tradition. And one of the conversations I and others at SNCC in particular have with today’s young activists is about protest is necessary, we say, but it’s not sufficient. You have to sustain a movement. You have to figure out how best to organize for change, how to speak to communities, how to speak to neighborhoods, how to put neighborhoods in the trenches with you. It’s sort of in some ways seems to me to be a new idea to them, and I understand it, because we had the same problem with our own evolution. All of us, myself, Stokely, all of us, came out of the sit-in movement, the nonviolent protest movement which we challenged segregation and white supremacy. Ms. Baker was encouraging us to think about organizing at the grassroots, but it was slow for us to come to that kind of understanding of the necessity.  Ironically, because I was 19 years old when I went to Mississippi, for our age group, it was the older people who took us by the hand and said, “Let us show you what we really need and let us introduce you to the people,” all of them older than we were, “who will help you fight with us to get what we really need.”  Eddie Conway: Charlie, not to cut you off, but that brings me to a point, because after the civil rights movement, obviously there was the Black Power movement that grew out of the civil rights movement, in fact, and then the Black Liberation movement, and now we have massive incarceration of millions of people, Black, Brown bodies, et cetera. Are we any better off now we went through all those processes- Charlie Cobb: Yeah.  Eddie Conway: … than we were then and why? Charlie Cobb: I think, one, I think I don’t … See, I see Black struggle as a continuous struggle with ups and downs since slavery, since the enslavement of Black people. So it takes on various qualities and characteristics over time, but it’s a mistake to talk about the civil rights era and the Black Power era and the whatever, because it’s not that. Black struggle in this country goes … And I tell people all the time, “Look, enslaved Africans were not marching in nonviolent protests on auction blocks. Enslaved Africans were not having sit-ins in plantation manor dining rooms.” What were they doing? Well, they were doing the best they could to fight to make life better. Sometimes that involved escape. Sometimes that involved rebellion. Sometimes that involved secret schools. Sometimes that included assassination. It included sabotage. It included … I mean, people pick the tactics and strategies they want to use in terms of the time period that they’re in. Slavery was abolished in 1863, so we don’t have slave rebellions anymore, but just because slavery was abolished through the Emancipation Proclamation, at least in the Confederate states, just because slavery didn’t mean that white supremacy and racism was eliminated. And Black people knew that, even if white people didn’t. They picked the weapons they felt necessary to fight it. So like I say, what we were doing in the 60s was using the weapons we thought best to fight white supremacy. The Movement for Black Lives will pick—not all their weapons are going to be the same as ours, and that’s okay. It’s all …  [inaudible 00:38:29] Mozambique [foreign language 00:38:30], the struggle continues. You make incremental progress. I don’t have a vision of a grand revolutionary change that emancipates everybody. I think it’s just a fact of life. You make evolutionary progress. Sometimes that’s a setback. For instance, take the Supreme Court. You could say, and I know people who have said this, older, you could say that Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice represents progress. Not something I would say, but I know people who would say that. So sometimes what you think of progress turns out not to be progress. Sometimes what you hadn’t thought of as being particularly significant turns out to be significant.  In the framework of Black struggle, people like me try and commit younger people to what I think is progressive struggle, but be clear, it’s what I think, and I’m not the gospel. I’m one guy living in this world, and I will tell you what I think is progressive, I will tell you what I think is reactionary, I’ll tell you why I think that or why I don’t think that, but the struggle continues. This current surge of youthful activism proves that, it seems to me, makes it inarguable that struggle continues. I’m 77, and I got off the phone yesterday with a guy just turned 22. I remember telling him, “You mean you’re old enough now for me to take you out for a drink or beer or something?” But he’s very active in North Carolina in struggle. I’m sure you’ve seen that in Baltimore and other places, because I imagine you had conversations with some of these young activists. I consider that progress, even if all the questions that need to be answered haven’t been answered. It’s progress that we have yet another generation that’s continuing to struggle. Then I realize … Of course, I’m writing about the Movement for Black Lives, now. The title, by the way, came from John Lewis, “Get in the Way.” It was one of his standard lines speaking to college students. “You see something wrong or you see something unfair, et cetera, et cetera, don’t be afraid. Get in the way. Stand up.” I took the line from John. So I realize because I just typed that John Lewis quote that there’s an even younger generation behind the millennials who are becoming active in the movement. These are the kids who are high school students, freshmen in college if they’re going to college, but they are 17, 18. Alicia Garza, whom I like a lot, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, is almost 40. While she’s young to me because I’m 77, even Derrick Johnson, the head of the NAACP, is 51. And I told him, because I know Derrick from when he was at [inaudible 00:42:44], “You’re young to me.” He wanted to know why I was interviewing him if I was doing a book about young activists. I said, “Aside from your role as head of the NAACP,” he was 50 when I interviewed him, “you just told me you turned 50. That makes you young to me.”  So there’s some flexibility in what we mean when we say young activists, but I don’t worry so much as long as I see young people in motion for change. I’m less worried about the future than when I see the kind of cowardice I see in newsrooms and the national legislature, the Congress or the White House. As long as I see meaningful young activism, it sort of renews my hope and it renews my faith in what’s possible in the way of change. The country has changed in some ways. I mean, one of the striking things about the round of demonstrations that began with the acquittal of George Zimmerman of the murder of Trayvon Martin, one of the things that striking to me, as somebody who remembers the 50s and 60s, is how diverse the protesters are, and also that these protests are international.  That’s really different than my experience in the 60s, and I find that a progressive change. I mean, you can go … I live in Jacksonville, Florida, north Florida, perhaps where the Ku Klux Klan is strongest, but you can go into white neighborhoods and see Black Lives Matter signs. That just didn’t happen, at least in my day. It just didn’t happen. Whatever comes of that, I say it reflects a kind of progress in the consciousness of the country, although there are powerful forces, and I don’t think people understand how powerful these forces are, working against this kind of change. When I say … I don’t mean by that saying Kamala Harris represents progressive change. I don’t know. I don’t know the lady. I really don’t know much about her politics, but I do know what I see on the street in the sense of the kind of activism that’s been unfolding for a decade now. I’ve had the opportunity, happily, to talk to them, because they’re interested in the experiences of people like me.  They might not know very much about SNCC, or CORE, or Ella Baker, or Fannie Lou Hamer, or Stokely Carmichael, but they’re interested in that. And they’re interested because they’re looking for things that they can use. When I was their age, civil rights struggle, until we sort of fell into it, was considered something grownups did. I never saw myself until the sit-ins happened in 1960, and then I’m looking at people like me, Diane Nash, and John Lewis, and a whole bunch of people, Julian Bond. They looked like me, and they were my age, and whatnot. So I consider this progress, all of this, and to the extent that it’s possible to retain some belief that the country will pull out of this stuff that Donald Trump and others have led … Although it goes back, much further back. And people forget the Southern Negro Youth Congress, which was formed in the 1930s, was destroyed by the McCarthy era tyrannies in the 1950s.  So this is not new, this stuff that Donald Trump is putting forth, and he plays to the lowest common denominators. So when you think of it that way, you think of this long struggle that’s both ahead of you and that has flourished behind you, and just being able to survive is hopeful.  Eddie Conway: So we’re going to end this on do you have any final thoughts that you’d like to share with older activists, as well as younger activists in terms of working together or- Charlie Cobb: Well, I think that- Eddie Conway: … moving forward? Charlie Cobb: I think the most important thing we older activists can do is to interact with today’s young activists. It doesn’t mean we have to be out on the street with them. That’ll depend on a lot of stuff, including health, but I think that experience that all of us have had, whether it’s SNCC, CORE, the Black Panther Party, all that stuff that we’ve experienced, we ought to share it, consciously share it, and consciously figure out ways to pass it on. It doesn’t mean they’re going to accept everything we say, but if you work hard to develop the right relationship with these young activists, they will not simply listen, but they’ll think about what you’re sharing with it and they’ll discard what they don’t need and they will use what they need. That’s a valuable thing if you’re to do … I’ve been a little disturbed at the distance so-called Black leaders take with regard to these young activists.  I can remember—this was some years back on one of the anniversaries of the March on Washington—when young activists were denied access to the stage by the civil rights establishment. That’s some wrong approach. I think Andy Young once called something they were doing stupid. You may disagree with some of the things that today’s young activists do, but stupid they’re not, and stupid shuts the door in their face. That’s stupid. We ought to give them a lot more support than they get. Here, I’m talking about the older people who reflect the leadership establishment in the Black community. It’s really important to do that and to demonstrate that, insofar as you’re concerned, what they’re doing is legitimate and necessary.  Eddie Conway: Okay, Charlie. Thank you. Thank you for that insight.  Charlie Cobb: Thank you. Eddie Conway: Thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. In 1980, Eddie Conway participated in and helped organize a prisoners’ educational outreach program called “To Say Their Own Words,” where thinkers and scholars came to Maryland Penitentiary and spoke about topics like impending U.S. fascism, the prison-industrial complex, capitalism, increased surveillance, and many other issues that have become even more pressing today. These speakers included Amiri Baraka, Askia Muhammad, Bruce Franklin, Nijole Benokraitis, and Charlie Cobb. As part of an ongoing series for TRNN’s Rattling the Bars, Eddie Conway speaks with these individuals about their predictions in 1980 and how they resonate today. This interview is with longtime civil rights activist, journalist, and author of “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed,” Charlie Cobb. In this speech, delivered to Maryland Penitentiary prisoners in 1980, journalist and civil rights activist Charlie Cobb discusses his experiences reporting in Rhodesia and the U.S., and explains how the news industry’s interests influence people’s understanding of themselves and the world. \n",

      " Content: One reason why The Real News Network calls Baltimore home is because we know that the struggles the people in this majority-minority city face (unequitable access to resources like education, clean air, and transportation, for example) are the struggles people face all over the globe.

      " Content: Maximillian Alvarez: Welcome, everyone, to The Real News Network. Thank you all so much for joining us. My name is Maximilian Alvarez. I’m the Editor-in-Chief here at The Real News, and I could not be more excited to be hosting this special panel discussion that we’ve got for you all today. We want to produce more of these types of discussions, along with the great shows, podcasts and articles that we publish at The Real News on a weekly basis. Please let us know what you think in the comments and on social media. Share these discussions with your friends and let us know what you want to see moving forward, what topics you want us to address and which guests you want us to bring on, and all that good stuff. Let’s dig into the topic for today, which is a juicy one and one that I’m sure everyone watching today has heard something about. As many of you probably already know, last week was a very interesting week on Wall Street. The stonks, as we’re calling them, the stonks were out of control. Or were they? How much control there really has been throughout this whole saga and who is doing the controlling, I think that’s one of the big topics that we want to address today.  Anyone who’s listened to me talk for any length of time knows all too well that I am not an economist, I am not a finance pro, and I’m not going to pretend to have the expertise and insight to explain what has been happening this past week on Wall Street, what the implications are and what this saga does and doesn’t mean for those of us who want to resist the dominance and the destruction of finance capital. That’s what we have our amazing panel of guests for.  For those who may have missed the news, the basic bullet points are last week a rag-tag group of day traders on Reddit worked together to buy shares of companies whose stock hasn’t been doing so hot as of late. The most central stock in question was that of the video game retailer GameStop, but other companies included AMC, the theater giant, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Private hedge funds regularly profit from shorting the stock of these types of companies, including GameStop, which essentially, means that they bet that the value of that stock is going to drop. There was a bit of a narrative that formed last week, this sort of David vs. Goliath narrative, where a bunch of day traders using apps like Robinhood where able to inflate the value of GameStop’s stock by buying it and thus make the hedge funds who were betting on shorting that stock lose a lot of money. But as each of our great panelists today have pointed out in amazing pieces that they have written for VICE, Jacobin and The New Republic, things aren’t so simple. I want to turn things over to them so that we can discuss what actually happened this past week, what’s happening now, what the implications of this are, and what it means for, again, any of us who want to actually formulate any sort of robust resistance to the dominance of Wall Street in our daily lives. Today, we are joined by an incredible panel of guests, including, Kate Aronoff, who is a brilliant staff writer at The New Republic. Kate is also the co-author of a great book that everyone should read called, A Planet To Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal. She was also the co-editor of We Own the Future: Democratic Socialism, American Style. Kate wrote a really great piece for The New Republic last week on what the GameStop debacle means for Wall Street’s ability to tackle major existential threats like climate change. We’re also joined by Edward Ongweso, Jr., who is a likewise brilliant tech and labor writer at VICE Motherboard. Edward is also the co-host of a truly excellent podcast called This Machine Kills, and it’s a podcast on technology and political economy. We’re also joined by radio legend Doug Henwood. Doug wrote a fantastic piece for Jacobin that was quickly used as a primer for anyone who wanted to understand what was happening with GameStop. Doug even went on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah to talk about it last week, so congrats, Doug. Doug Henwood: Thanks. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, man. Doug edits Left Business Observer and he is the co-host of Behind The News. His latest book is My Turn, which everyone should check out.  You three are all much smarter than me when it comes to this kind of stuff. I wanted to turn things over and just ask for each of you, as you were watching these events unfold, what was really captivating your attention and what did you feel compelled to write about and explain? Why don’t we go in reverse order and start with Doug. What prompted you to write the piece that you did for Jacobin? Doug Henwood: First of all, it’s not normal. The kinds of things I follow and write about and talk about, have for over 30 years, financial markets and such, make it to such prominence. They’re mostly just the train of specialist and connoisseurs and weirdos like me. I think there were many comic aspects to all of it, all around. It was funny to see these hedge fund guys suffer. It was funny to see Wall Street complain about there was something dishonest or underhanded about what the Reddit guys did, because Wall Street does that sort of thing all the time. They look for weak players, they look for modes of attack and they often conspire in very similar ways.  Then to see the claims of the Redditers that they were somehow launching some kind of populist democratic assault on the princes of finance is also ludicrous. A lot of those guys just want to get rich themselves. A lot of them may have been hedge funders in disguise trying to dump their positions on the unsuspecting. The idea of Robin Hood as being some kind of democratic platform for overturning the financial system just is laughable. Among other things, they route their trades through one of the, Citadel, which is founded by one of the biggest hedge funds in the country, Citadel Securities. The way to gain power over Wall Street is not by playing their games or trying to outwit them or play their games better than they do. They way to gain power over Wall Street is to organize politically, get state action to control them and get workers more power and capitalists less power. That’s way to get control over Wall Street. There’s kind of a libertarian individualistic flavor to a lot of the Robinhood stuff, which is dishonest and comical. I saw somebody tweet and I can’t remember who it was, but if you think concerted trades of these sort can undo a financial capitalist, wait until we tell you what a general strike could do. I think we need to think more about general strikes and less about concerted attacks on some hedge funds that will have no effect in the long term on the power or health of the capitalist system. Maximillian Alvarez: That was another kind of narrative that quickly emerged by the end of last week, where, like you said, Doug, it’s like the way to mobilize resistance to the game of Wall Street is not to play that game the way they want you to play it. I think what a lot of people noticed was kind of how rigged that game is when Robin Hood basically prevented people from being able to continue to buy stocks in GameStop. That really kind of set a lot of people off. I just kind of wanted to mention that because I- Doug Henwood: I must say, to be fair to them, and not that I really want to be too fair to them, but we must say that they did have the risk. They’re exposed to the risk that the people who are buying that stock couldn’t pay. There are a whole lot of amateurs who may not have had a lot of money. There can be a lot of investigation about what went on here. There’s obviously some interest in protecting the powerful, but they’re also trying to protect their own solvency. It’s going to be interesting to sort that out over the coming weeks and months. Maximillian Alvarez: Absolutely, and I know that’s something that, Edward, you’ve been kind of looking deeply into with the multiple articles that you’ve written over at Motherboard. Why don’t we throw things to you. As you were watching this unfold and as you are currently watching it unfold, what sorts of things have been kind of really gripping your attention? Edward Ongweso Jr.: Yeah. Definitely, I have been really interested in the contesting narratives that have been emerging and coming to light. As Doug talked about on the one hand, the idea of a populist revolt and the other hand the idea that this is like some retail investors gone wild and they need to be regulated, and then also whether this was the platform’s fault, Robinhood’s fault, if there was a conspiratorial element or the collateral requirement that came into play.  I think it’s been interesting because all of these, in different ways, have obscured the fact that none of this is fundamentally undermining, threatening or changing the larger financial system. Actually, it’s feeding into this PR marketing ploy that Robinhood and other firms have been trying for years, which is that universal stock ownership is really the way to go and they’re just trying to democratize finance, they’re just trying to make sure everybody can trade stocks. Most Americans, if they touch a stock, it’s through retirement savings, it’s not through some day trading activity. Also, a lot of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, so day trading would just be a devastating blow to them because it’s akin to gambling in many instances, especially the way that they gamify the platform at Robinhood. This idea of having finance be democratized, it has an interest in, I guess, flattening what’s actually going on and obscuring who’s benefits are being satisfied by it, obscuring the role of BlackRock in the sense that BlackRock is a major investor in GameStop. While short-sellers were scaring for stock, BlackRock is there to lend securities to them if they need it, and able to make millions off of such a program, as are other institutional investors. Whether it’s at AMC, with BlackRock, again, and Fidelity and VanGuard or any of the other stocks that keep getting pushed up by some of the communities on social media traders and hype cycles in general.  I think that as the focus gets lost, we keep getting pulled back into that libertarian impulse that Doug was talking about, where it’s just like you and the market and you just have to rely on your quick wits and information from other people as opposed to the fact that if you really want change, trading stocks in not going to do it. It might help you get rich or make some money if you’re lucky, but more often than not, you’re just going to make money for Robinhood, who’s selling your information to Citadel Group, which is then probably, its hedge fund is making a bet against it, or front-running the trade in Citadel Securities itself, because they’re a market-maker. It’s all just, it feels very much like an attempt to use this to reaffirm and relegitimize the narrative that the market, the stock market, they’re rational, they are important, they play a key role in making sure economic reality goes along smoothly whereas what this demonstrates is this absurdity that bubbles are common, bubbles happen but this, I think, speaks to what people have been recognizing over time, especially during the pandemic, that the stock market, in that it really doesn’t correspond with the reality that workers or general people deal with day to day, and that it goes up no matter what, and they’ll probably lose if they try to play or get involved. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, so I definitely want to kind of circle back to that. I guess kind of playing on Doug’s line about you’re not going to beat your opponent by playing its game. Edward, you had a really killer line in one of your pieces where you said, as long as the house is still standing, the house is always going to win. I want to kind of turn back to that in a second but, Kate, I wanted to bring you in because you had, I think, a really interesting and unique kind of take on everything that was unfolding last week. Could we talk about as you were watching things unfold, what you saw was missing in the discourse and what you really wanted to kind of focus on? Kate Aronoff: Yeah, I tried to ignore the story for as long as possible, and thought that I would be safely insulated from it in the climate [inaudible 00:13:19], and that turned out not to be the case. I’m glad I did end up paying attention to it. There’s not a sort of natural end to it from climate, but something that I’ve been tracking for the last year and a little bit more than that, is what’s been happening in the oil and gas sector and particularly shale, shale drilling, which really blew up right after the financial crisis in 2008. It’s this creature, sort of, of low interest rates, a very cheap debt. It doesn’t really make sense unless you have those things in place. What you saw along the same period that you have tech stocks really rising in valuation, is fracking becomes this really sort of huge thing and profitable in a way that it just wasn’t, or not profitable, actually. You have companies of huge valuations who can now do this very hugely capital-intensive form of drilling and becoming rich. People get really rich off of it and it becomes a really important part of the energy landscape the world over. Looking at this GameStop story and thinking, well, you know, there’s something actually sort of parallel in this, because one is the underlying value of GameStop. The company itself did not sort of revolutionize the way it was selling games as its valuation went up. Similarly, neither companies like Chesapeake Energy or any of the other big players in the shale revolution, they weren’t doing anything necessarily different than they were doing before debt got really cheap, before interest rates went down, but they sold themselves as something revolutionary, as being this really powerful force, and then they sort of became it. That didn’t change the fact that most of those companies have not turned a profit in the last 10 years, and have consistently failed to make any money. I think this is a weird sort of creature of the last 10 years. I think Doug can certainly speak to a species of this, but that you have a really sort of tenuous relationship between what it is companies are doing and sort of what their valuation is. The most absurd example of this is something like WeWork, or Theranos or Drucero, these sort of notorious companies that get these huge valuations, whether they go public or not, and just based on very little.  What that says to me and I think what we can take from this week or so is that there’s nothing inherently rational of markets. There’s no magic that groups of venture capitalist have to decide what activities are valuable, and they’re operating in this space that is entirely constructed by the state. The whole world that Wall Street operates in only exists just because certain laws exist to make it possible, and we can change what those laws are.  We can change the sort of frame in which Wall Street operates, whether that’s through regulations or other sorts of predistribution or taxation. I think we can just really not take evaluation at face value, and I think that, if that is a lesson that can come out of this GameStop saga, I think that’ll be a good one just to say it’s not that Exxon Mobile or Chesapeake Energy or any of these companies inherently valuable. There’s no magic to that, but that there are individuals making very idiosyncratic decisions about what people get to become billionaires. Maximillian Alvarez: Let’s talk about that, because this is something that I think connects the different pieces that all three of you wrote about this. In terms of what the GameStop saga reveals, or re-reveals, is this kind of disconnect between what we are told the stock market is, what its function is in society and the economy, and what it actually is, and where kind of average working people fit in that whole equation. I think that most people, as Edward mentioned, will only really have a connection to the stock market based on what they see on the news, when we’re always told that the stock market is doing great, even when the economy for the rest of us doesn’t seem to be doing all that well. People probably remember it from the Great Recession, families like my own lost everything in that recession, including our homes. I think that perhaps on top of that, that kind of reveals why this is such a significant story for so many people, because the world of Wall Street feels so disconnected from our daily realities, except when we learn about how it’s relating to our pensions or something like that. It feels just so disconnected and so far out of our reach that I think the very fact that regular people, the regular people who were involved, not to say that’s all the people who were involved, but the people who were involved on Reddit and day trading, who saw the stock price go up for GameStop, I think that in a society that so thoroughly disempowers us, convinces us that we have so little ability to change the machine, the system that our lives take place in, to do something that had a visible impact on Wall Street, it was too much for anyone to compute. Just seeing that kind of impact that people could have on something like the stock market was partially what made this such a big story. Doug, I know that this has been a really big issue for you, and you’ve been leading this charge for many years to kind of highlight the disconnect between what Wall Street says it is, what the stock market says it is, and what it actually is. Could you talk a little bit about how that relates to what unfolded over the past week? Doug Henwood: Yeah. This theory is that the stock market is supposed to be a way of rationally allocating capital on a system-wide basis towards the most profitable pursuit, most worthy pursuits, which are also the most profitable pursuits in standard ideology. That’s just nonsensical. The stock market has almost nothing to do with funding real businesses, really close to nothing to do. Almost all the stock that is traded was issued years ago, companies don’t get any money out of their stock at all. Every now and then, you have a company doing a public offering. They’re relatively small. The trading apparatus that has grown up around it is so much larger than any of that. Venture capital firms actually do fund new businesses. That, too, is relatively small compared to the size of the rest of Wall Street. That story, that is has something to do with a rational allocation of capital is utterly nonsensical. I’m going to say there are two important features of the stock market. One is that it’s just a giant arena of mob psychology. The best thing ever written on speculative markets is Chapter 12 of Keynes’ General Theory. He does a psychoanalysis of the stock market. One of the points he makes is that to be a successful investor, you don’t have to anticipate what the actual future is going to be, just what people think the actual future is going to be. As he said, [inaudible 00:20:48] to ape unreason proleptically. It’s a lovely phrase that most economists today can’t write.  Yeah, it’s just a big mob game. You’re trying to outwit the other guy, you’re trying to be there first and leave somebody else holding the bag when it all goes bad. And somebody’s going to get left holding a lot of bags after this GameStop thing is over, I’m sure. And now, they’re moving in on silver, although it’s debatable exactly who “they” is in this case. The other aspect of it is, I think that most people overlook, is that the market doesn’t provide funding for real businesses, but it’s a way to create a whole class of owners, a way of creating an owning class. In the 19th century, most businesses were owned by either individual capitalists or a small partnership of capitalists. As the 19th turned into the 20th century, you developed these large public corporations that are owned by outside stockholders, and that meant that rich people were able to own, they were not tied to the fate of a single firm anymore. They were able to spread their risk and own or have a claim in the entire apparatus of the economy.  That’s another way of thinking of a stock market, is a way to create an owning class. They extract tons and tons of money through dividends, through stock buy-backs, through capital gains. Trillions and trillions of dollars. The idea that it’s investors providing money to companies through the stock market is exactly backwards. It’s that companies are providing money to their investors through just transferring trillions of dollars through these various mechanisms. Finally, every time that there’s some kind of disruption in the stock market, you hear these people warning, well, people, it’s going to hurt the little guy because of his pension plan. Only about half of American families have any kind of retirement account at all. The average size of that is about $65,000. That’s roughly a year’s income for a typical American household, and that’s only half of households that have these kinds of retirement accounts. For most people, it’s utterly marginal. It’s really a story for the top 10 percent, the top five percent of the society. Somehow, they create these ideas that it’s really everyone’s, when it’s really not. Maximillian Alvarez: I think you mentioned this on The Daily Show, that around 95 percent of stocks are owned by, like, the top five percent. Doug Henwood: Yeah, and that’s people who own stock directly, not through mutual funds or pension funds, but people who own stock directly. If you look at it more broadly, through the indirect ownership, it’s also extraordinarily concentrated. For most people it’s, not just most, almost everyone, it’s utterly meaningless. Maximillian Alvarez: I’m tempted to name this conversation Aping Unreason now. Doug Henwood: (laughs)  Edward Ongweso Jr.: (laughs) Doug Henwood: Proleptically. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, proleptically. Edward, I know that this is also something that really comes through in the pieces that you’ve been writing. In the arena, that arena that Keynes wrote about of aping unreason proleptically, people who trade on Wall Street, they’re not stupid. They’re trying to kind of minimize and mitigate the risks that they’re going to take, and that’s kind of something that has been born out in the writing that you’ve done, where you’ve shown, look, this isn’t necessarily a David vs. Goliath sort of story where a bunch of rag-tag Redditers made hedge funds lose a lot of money.  That’s part of the story, but also, like you said, firms like BlackRock, who have more holdings than any other firm in the world, they made a killing on this. Could you talk about, in terms of your kind of thesis that as long as the house is still standing, the house is always going to win? Could you talk a bit about how that kind of shadow game that the stock market is, that Doug talked about, how the kind of key players that you’ve been focusing on are trying to kind of control the amount of risk that they take on in that game? Edward Ongweso Jr.: Institutional investors, they are, I think a big general problem in terms of corporate governance, in terms of how public companies, publicly-listed companies are actually run, there is something, I guess referred to generally, is like a problem of 12, where there’s a threat or a risk, that through partly the concentration of ownership and shares that a few large asset managers, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have either top shareholder position or one of the top five shareholder positions in like 90 percent of the S&P, also coupled with the way in which these firms can take advantage of their wide holdings to issue positions, views, memos that benefit from the massive amount of holding they have to push boards to act one way, vote against a resolution, vote for a resolution, vote for a director, not a director, or by accumulating enough of the voting power, that they are the swing and decisor vote.  Institutional investors, the real threat with them is they get obscured in these moments as operators that can influence, block social policy, political policy, veto it, essentially. I think climate is a really great example on this. Kate has reported a lot on how BlackRock itself stands in the way of a lot of potential climate policy simply because it can say, on the one hand, we’ll stop investing in this fossil fuel extraction. They’ll say they’ll stop investing in coal, but they have billions of dollars elsewhere still invested, and by virtue of investing it, they give an industry that should otherwise be dying, is unprofitable, is inflated in value, more political power, more capital to burn, more resilience and viability when it otherwise shouldn’t, and won’t, because of the looming threat of regulations. Similarly, when we are talking about the financial system, the power that these entities have, it’s still not scrutinized as closely as it should be, whether it’s because of their ability to inculcate themselves in the Cabinet, whether it’s because their focus is something that most Americans are not just dealing with in day-to-day life, they are concerns to anyone who’s interested in making sure that public policy and regulations can rein in these firms. As long as they’re still allowed to operate with little to no scrutiny, you cannot bet against them in any way, or you can’t run against them, you can’t field policies that oppose them, you can’t seriously threaten them, unless you are going to undermine their hold on corporations across the economy, across the world. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah. This time last year, give or take a couple of weeks, there was a nationwide strike in France when Emmanuel Macron was proposing to kind of totally revamp the pension system there. I remember interviewing a bunch of French strikers involved then, and there was a reason that, in January I believe, a bunch of the French strikers went to the headquarters of BlackRock and made a bonfire in their foyer. They knew who the shadowy enemy behind Macron’s policy was. I think that you’re right, and as Kate has reported, we need look no further than energy and oil and all that stuff, and how the major players there have been kind of rigging the game. Kate, could you talk a little bit about that, and also, I know that you mentioned in your article this kind of totally ridiculous ideology that firms like BlackRock will say, where there’s an inherent rationality to the market that is going to be the driving force behind solving climate change? Kate Aronoff: Yeah. Yeah. BlackRock is so interesting, and I think it’s helpful to sort of parse out a couple different things that are happening. One is that, as I had mentioned, BlackRock has just at every turn sought to insulate itself from any sort of regulation, most famously making sure that it wasn’t a systemically important financial institution, to lobby it aggressively, to prevent, even though it’s a sort of monopoly provider of the software called Aladdin, the risk management software, to central banks all over the world, and that is just really deeply woven into the global financial system. It is, by all accounts, a systemically important financial institution. That, and it is integrating itself into the Biden administration in order to make sure that it is insulated further from sort of basic democratic accountability. That’s one thing, and then the other thing that’s interesting about BlackRock is that it’s not an investment bank. It is sort of what it says it is, it sells itself as, which is a big asset manager.  What that means, with regard to climate, is that so long as the companies it’s investing in, it’s investing its clients’ money in, are profitable, they’ll keep investing in those. The vast majority of BlackRock’s products are these passive investment funds. That’s where they make most of their money, is through these funds they don’t really control. It will be like the S&P 500 that it’s indexed to, and so what they’ve done in trying to make this kind of climate turn is to create new financial products, new sustainable investment platforms, this sort of niche operating, part of their operations, which are getting bigger. [ESP 00:30:58] is becoming more profitable. It is becoming more and more profitable to invest in green things, but their bread and butter continues to be these passive funds, which are investing in Exxon Mobil and Chevron, in all of the big oil and gas companies and that they’re not really trying to change. They’re not really trying to change what that is. On the one hand, BlackRock needs to be regulated much more heavily than it is right now, but something also has to make those companies unprofitable in order for them to stop investing in them. Otherwise, they’re going to do what they do, which is to make money. That’s the only reason why BlackRock exists. It has no social mission, it has no sort of the higher order thoughts about what the planet should look like. It’s just there to make money.  Until Exxon Mobil or Chevron or BP or whatever is not profitable anymore, they’ll keep funneling money into them. I think that’s what really has to happen, is that you have to cut off and phase down fossil fuel production at its source, and pass commonsense regulations to make those companies, which are massively over-valued, they’re pumped up with subsidies, have gotten bailed out in the last year, are being really propped up by all of the state policy. You have to make that unprofitable in order for BlackRock to stop doing that, in order for BlackRock to stop funneling money into them. I think there’s a couple different things that have to happen, and BlackRock is really at the center of making sure that not many of them do. Maximillian Alvarez: In our remaining few minutes, let’s talk about the what-is-to-be-done question. I think that one thing that is very clear from our conversation is that there are multiple ways that we should be thinking about that question. There is kind of the role that government can play in terms of regulating these things, but there is also the role that people can play in, like you said, Kate, kind of cutting things off at the source or disrupting the system where it’s most vulnerable. I know, Doug, that’s what you kind of said at the beginning when you talked about a general strike would be a much more effective strategy than everyone hopping on Robinhood and trying to lose a bunch of money for hedge fund managers. By way of rounding out, what do you all think about what the big take-aways from this are, in terms of what people who see the destructiveness that is inherent in what we have watched unfold over this past week, and even the past decades, people who want to do something about it, what options do we have, both on the governmental side and on the grassroots side? Doug, what do you think? Doug Henwood: What I’d like to see people take away from this, for one, is that the financial markets are economically somewhere between pointless and destructive. It disappointed me to see some people finding some political meaning in these shenanigans. I enjoyed the schadenfreude as much as anyone, but we have to realize it’s not going to change anything in the long term. A concluding observation, something that could be done, which if we wanted to talk about climate, which is probably the most important long-term issue the world faces, strike the probably, it is the most important long-term issue the world faces. There could be some very interesting things that would come out of the financial regulators. The Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, some years ago made some noise, rather lonely at first, in which he said that financial markets have to recognize that carbon assets are going to be worthless some day. Shell and all the others are trading at high prices now, but they’re really sitting on assets that are going to be worth zero at some point. Regulators need to force companies and the markets to recognize this fact. Janet Yellen has made some noises along those lines. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has. It’s not revolutionary. It’s not a general strike, but it’s something very constructive that regulators could do to really change this. It’s not going to happen because the carbon companies see the light some day. They need to be forced to. That’s the way to do it, expropriate them through rather technocratic means, but it would have a profound effect. Maximillian Alvarez: Edward, what about you? What do you think some of the big take-aways are from this? Edward Ongweso Jr.: I think one of the big take-aways is it feels the capital markets, or at least the rules around capital markets, are just too loose to allow, or to expect, as Doug was talking about, real change to just come from them. I think Larry Fink in Kate’s article said something like he wants capitalism to be self-regulating, as he sits on $8 trillion in assets and $21 trillion, that we know about, on Aladdin, which manages other peoples’ assets. This is small things, or I mean, not small, but reclassifying BlackRock and other asset managers too big to fail, reining them in, putting limits on passively-managed fund, actively-managed funds, but also, I think, stepping back with regards to markets themselves, figuring out how to rein in a stock market that is just decoupled from reality, or figuring out what we want to do with that.  At the end of the day, this bubble with GameStop is also reflected with the fact that you can have companies like Uber, which never make a profit, business models exploitation, up billions of dollars after passing certain laws that let them keep their business model. You can have companies like WeWork that almost hit the market with no discernible business model as well, other than burning investor capital.  These all speak to just the fundamental inefficiency of capital markets, and through the unbelievable amounts of power and autonomy that they seem to have from regulation. States need to come in and intervene. As everybody’s talked about here, all these faces are constructed because of the state, either through laws or also through norms that are enforced, or specific regulations, they can be constrained even further or regulation and oversight can be expanded even further. Until that is looked at vs. what some of the largest capitalists want, which is to just keep self-regulating, then there’s nothing that’s going to happen. All of that also needs to be happening at the same time as developing political power and labor power to push back on the ground as well. Maximillian Alvarez: Kate, what are your take-away thoughts on this? Kate Aronoff: Yeah, I would agree with everything Doug and Ed said, especially the fact that sort of mucking around in financial markets is a really poor substitute for class struggle. In Ed’s piece, he put it, the house always wins. I grew up 45 minutes from LA in [inaudible 00:38:31] City and you’re not going to beat the casino by playing the game and, more often than not, a casino will extract money from the community. It’s the real world, the story. I think if this shed some light on just the nonsense that’s been happening on Wall Street, I think that’s good but, at the end of the day, I think the challenge is basically the same, which is as everyone has said, to have the state really place constraints and more proactively shape the world in which Wall Street operates, if not destroy whole parts of that world which are just inherently sort of destructive and also to build power, which I don’t foresee happening probably on Wall Street. That’s Reddit pages and will probably happen in more places among people coming together online and in real life. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah. I’m not a betting man, but I would bet building worker power may be a more effective strategy. Unfortunately, that’s all the time that we have for today, but I so thoroughly enjoyed this discussion and I can’t thank our amazing panelists enough for making time to share their insights with us. If you enjoyed this conversation, please let us know about it. Like I said at the top of the conversation, let us know what types of topics you want us to cover moving forward. Thank you all for joining us for The Real News Network. I’m Editor-in-Chief Maximilian Alvarez. Wall Street was in a tizzy last week after a band of Redditors on the forum r/wallstreetbets worked together to drastically inflate the stock price of brick-and-mortar retailers like GameStop. The guerrilla stock-buying surge caused some hedge funds shorting GameStop stock to lose a boatload of money, and a David vs. Goliath narrative emerged—but the story is more complicated than that. On this special panel, hosted by TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez, we talk about what actually happened last week on Wall Street, who the winners and losers are, and what this whole saga means for those who want to resist the domination of finance capital. Our brilliant panel includes: Doug Henwood, economic journalist and host of “Behind the News”; Kate Aronoff, staff writer at The New Republic and author of “Overheated: How Capitalism Broke the Planet—And How We Fight Back”; and Edward Ongweso Jr., staff writer at Motherboard (Vice) and co-host of “This Machine Kills” podcast. \n",

      " Content: Maximillian Alvarez: Welcome, everyone, to The Real News Network. Thank you all so much for joining us. My name is Maximilian Alvarez. I’m the Editor-in-Chief here at The Real News, and I could not be more excited to be hosting this special panel discussion that we’ve got for you all today. We want to produce more of these types of discussions, along with the great shows, podcasts and articles that we publish at The Real News on a weekly basis. Please let us know what you think in the comments and on social media. Share these discussions with your friends and let us know what you want to see moving forward, what topics you want us to address and which guests you want us to bring on, and all that good stuff. Let’s dig into the topic for today, which is a juicy one and one that I’m sure everyone watching today has heard something about. As many of you probably already know, last week was a very interesting week on Wall Street. The stonks, as we’re calling them, the stonks were out of control. Or were they? How much control there really has been throughout this whole saga and who is doing the controlling, I think that’s one of the big topics that we want to address today.  Anyone who’s listened to me talk for any length of time knows all too well that I am not an economist, I am not a finance pro, and I’m not going to pretend to have the expertise and insight to explain what has been happening this past week on Wall Street, what the implications are and what this saga does and doesn’t mean for those of us who want to resist the dominance and the destruction of finance capital. That’s what we have our amazing panel of guests for.  For those who may have missed the news, the basic bullet points are last week a rag-tag group of day traders on Reddit worked together to buy shares of companies whose stock hasn’t been doing so hot as of late. The most central stock in question was that of the video game retailer GameStop, but other companies included AMC, the theater giant, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Private hedge funds regularly profit from shorting the stock of these types of companies, including GameStop, which essentially, means that they bet that the value of that stock is going to drop. There was a bit of a narrative that formed last week, this sort of David vs. Goliath narrative, where a bunch of day traders using apps like Robinhood where able to inflate the value of GameStop’s stock by buying it and thus make the hedge funds who were betting on shorting that stock lose a lot of money. But as each of our great panelists today have pointed out in amazing pieces that they have written for VICE, Jacobin and The New Republic, things aren’t so simple. I want to turn things over to them so that we can discuss what actually happened this past week, what’s happening now, what the implications of this are, and what it means for, again, any of us who want to actually formulate any sort of robust resistance to the dominance of Wall Street in our daily lives. Today, we are joined by an incredible panel of guests, including, Kate Aronoff, who is a brilliant staff writer at The New Republic. Kate is also the co-author of a great book that everyone should read called, A Planet To Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal. She was also the co-editor of We Own the Future: Democratic Socialism, American Style. Kate wrote a really great piece for The New Republic last week on what the GameStop debacle means for Wall Street’s ability to tackle major existential threats like climate change. We’re also joined by Edward Ongweso, Jr., who is a likewise brilliant tech and labor writer at VICE Motherboard. Edward is also the co-host of a truly excellent podcast called This Machine Kills, and it’s a podcast on technology and political economy. We’re also joined by radio legend Doug Henwood. Doug wrote a fantastic piece for Jacobin that was quickly used as a primer for anyone who wanted to understand what was happening with GameStop. Doug even went on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah to talk about it last week, so congrats, Doug. Doug Henwood: Thanks. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, man. Doug edits Left Business Observer and he is the co-host of Behind The News. His latest book is My Turn, which everyone should check out.  You three are all much smarter than me when it comes to this kind of stuff. I wanted to turn things over and just ask for each of you, as you were watching these events unfold, what was really captivating your attention and what did you feel compelled to write about and explain? Why don’t we go in reverse order and start with Doug. What prompted you to write the piece that you did for Jacobin? Doug Henwood: First of all, it’s not normal. The kinds of things I follow and write about and talk about, have for over 30 years, financial markets and such, make it to such prominence. They’re mostly just the train of specialist and connoisseurs and weirdos like me. I think there were many comic aspects to all of it, all around. It was funny to see these hedge fund guys suffer. It was funny to see Wall Street complain about there was something dishonest or underhanded about what the Reddit guys did, because Wall Street does that sort of thing all the time. They look for weak players, they look for modes of attack and they often conspire in very similar ways.  Then to see the claims of the Redditers that they were somehow launching some kind of populist democratic assault on the princes of finance is also ludicrous. A lot of those guys just want to get rich themselves. A lot of them may have been hedge funders in disguise trying to dump their positions on the unsuspecting. The idea of Robin Hood as being some kind of democratic platform for overturning the financial system just is laughable. Among other things, they route their trades through one of the, Citadel, which is founded by one of the biggest hedge funds in the country, Citadel Securities. The way to gain power over Wall Street is not by playing their games or trying to outwit them or play their games better than they do. They way to gain power over Wall Street is to organize politically, get state action to control them and get workers more power and capitalists less power. That’s way to get control over Wall Street. There’s kind of a libertarian individualistic flavor to a lot of the Robinhood stuff, which is dishonest and comical. I saw somebody tweet and I can’t remember who it was, but if you think concerted trades of these sort can undo a financial capitalist, wait until we tell you what a general strike could do. I think we need to think more about general strikes and less about concerted attacks on some hedge funds that will have no effect in the long term on the power or health of the capitalist system. Maximillian Alvarez: That was another kind of narrative that quickly emerged by the end of last week, where, like you said, Doug, it’s like the way to mobilize resistance to the game of Wall Street is not to play that game the way they want you to play it. I think what a lot of people noticed was kind of how rigged that game is when Robin Hood basically prevented people from being able to continue to buy stocks in GameStop. That really kind of set a lot of people off. I just kind of wanted to mention that because I- Doug Henwood: I must say, to be fair to them, and not that I really want to be too fair to them, but we must say that they did have the risk. They’re exposed to the risk that the people who are buying that stock couldn’t pay. There are a whole lot of amateurs who may not have had a lot of money. There can be a lot of investigation about what went on here. There’s obviously some interest in protecting the powerful, but they’re also trying to protect their own solvency. It’s going to be interesting to sort that out over the coming weeks and months. Maximillian Alvarez: Absolutely, and I know that’s something that, Edward, you’ve been kind of looking deeply into with the multiple articles that you’ve written over at Motherboard. Why don’t we throw things to you. As you were watching this unfold and as you are currently watching it unfold, what sorts of things have been kind of really gripping your attention? Edward Ongweso Jr.: Yeah. Definitely, I have been really interested in the contesting narratives that have been emerging and coming to light. As Doug talked about on the one hand, the idea of a populist revolt and the other hand the idea that this is like some retail investors gone wild and they need to be regulated, and then also whether this was the platform’s fault, Robinhood’s fault, if there was a conspiratorial element or the collateral requirement that came into play.  I think it’s been interesting because all of these, in different ways, have obscured the fact that none of this is fundamentally undermining, threatening or changing the larger financial system. Actually, it’s feeding into this PR marketing ploy that Robinhood and other firms have been trying for years, which is that universal stock ownership is really the way to go and they’re just trying to democratize finance, they’re just trying to make sure everybody can trade stocks. Most Americans, if they touch a stock, it’s through retirement savings, it’s not through some day trading activity. Also, a lot of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, so day trading would just be a devastating blow to them because it’s akin to gambling in many instances, especially the way that they gamify the platform at Robinhood. This idea of having finance be democratized, it has an interest in, I guess, flattening what’s actually going on and obscuring who’s benefits are being satisfied by it, obscuring the role of BlackRock in the sense that BlackRock is a major investor in GameStop. While short-sellers were scaring for stock, BlackRock is there to lend securities to them if they need it, and able to make millions off of such a program, as are other institutional investors. Whether it’s at AMC, with BlackRock, again, and Fidelity and VanGuard or any of the other stocks that keep getting pushed up by some of the communities on social media traders and hype cycles in general.  I think that as the focus gets lost, we keep getting pulled back into that libertarian impulse that Doug was talking about, where it’s just like you and the market and you just have to rely on your quick wits and information from other people as opposed to the fact that if you really want change, trading stocks in not going to do it. It might help you get rich or make some money if you’re lucky, but more often than not, you’re just going to make money for Robinhood, who’s selling your information to Citadel Group, which is then probably, its hedge fund is making a bet against it, or front-running the trade in Citadel Securities itself, because they’re a market-maker. It’s all just, it feels very much like an attempt to use this to reaffirm and relegitimize the narrative that the market, the stock market, they’re rational, they are important, they play a key role in making sure economic reality goes along smoothly whereas what this demonstrates is this absurdity that bubbles are common, bubbles happen but this, I think, speaks to what people have been recognizing over time, especially during the pandemic, that the stock market, in that it really doesn’t correspond with the reality that workers or general people deal with day to day, and that it goes up no matter what, and they’ll probably lose if they try to play or get involved. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, so I definitely want to kind of circle back to that. I guess kind of playing on Doug’s line about you’re not going to beat your opponent by playing its game. Edward, you had a really killer line in one of your pieces where you said, as long as the house is still standing, the house is always going to win. I want to kind of turn back to that in a second but, Kate, I wanted to bring you in because you had, I think, a really interesting and unique kind of take on everything that was unfolding last week. Could we talk about as you were watching things unfold, what you saw was missing in the discourse and what you really wanted to kind of focus on? Kate Aronoff: Yeah, I tried to ignore the story for as long as possible, and thought that I would be safely insulated from it in the climate [inaudible 00:13:19], and that turned out not to be the case. I’m glad I did end up paying attention to it. There’s not a sort of natural end to it from climate, but something that I’ve been tracking for the last year and a little bit more than that, is what’s been happening in the oil and gas sector and particularly shale, shale drilling, which really blew up right after the financial crisis in 2008. It’s this creature, sort of, of low interest rates, a very cheap debt. It doesn’t really make sense unless you have those things in place. What you saw along the same period that you have tech stocks really rising in valuation, is fracking becomes this really sort of huge thing and profitable in a way that it just wasn’t, or not profitable, actually. You have companies of huge valuations who can now do this very hugely capital-intensive form of drilling and becoming rich. People get really rich off of it and it becomes a really important part of the energy landscape the world over. Looking at this GameStop story and thinking, well, you know, there’s something actually sort of parallel in this, because one is the underlying value of GameStop. The company itself did not sort of revolutionize the way it was selling games as its valuation went up. Similarly, neither companies like Chesapeake Energy or any of the other big players in the shale revolution, they weren’t doing anything necessarily different than they were doing before debt got really cheap, before interest rates went down, but they sold themselves as something revolutionary, as being this really powerful force, and then they sort of became it. That didn’t change the fact that most of those companies have not turned a profit in the last 10 years, and have consistently failed to make any money. I think this is a weird sort of creature of the last 10 years. I think Doug can certainly speak to a species of this, but that you have a really sort of tenuous relationship between what it is companies are doing and sort of what their valuation is. The most absurd example of this is something like WeWork, or Theranos or Drucero, these sort of notorious companies that get these huge valuations, whether they go public or not, and just based on very little.  What that says to me and I think what we can take from this week or so is that there’s nothing inherently rational of markets. There’s no magic that groups of venture capitalist have to decide what activities are valuable, and they’re operating in this space that is entirely constructed by the state. The whole world that Wall Street operates in only exists just because certain laws exist to make it possible, and we can change what those laws are.  We can change the sort of frame in which Wall Street operates, whether that’s through regulations or other sorts of predistribution or taxation. I think we can just really not take evaluation at face value, and I think that, if that is a lesson that can come out of this GameStop saga, I think that’ll be a good one just to say it’s not that Exxon Mobile or Chesapeake Energy or any of these companies inherently valuable. There’s no magic to that, but that there are individuals making very idiosyncratic decisions about what people get to become billionaires. Maximillian Alvarez: Let’s talk about that, because this is something that I think connects the different pieces that all three of you wrote about this. In terms of what the GameStop saga reveals, or re-reveals, is this kind of disconnect between what we are told the stock market is, what its function is in society and the economy, and what it actually is, and where kind of average working people fit in that whole equation. I think that most people, as Edward mentioned, will only really have a connection to the stock market based on what they see on the news, when we’re always told that the stock market is doing great, even when the economy for the rest of us doesn’t seem to be doing all that well. People probably remember it from the Great Recession, families like my own lost everything in that recession, including our homes. I think that perhaps on top of that, that kind of reveals why this is such a significant story for so many people, because the world of Wall Street feels so disconnected from our daily realities, except when we learn about how it’s relating to our pensions or something like that. It feels just so disconnected and so far out of our reach that I think the very fact that regular people, the regular people who were involved, not to say that’s all the people who were involved, but the people who were involved on Reddit and day trading, who saw the stock price go up for GameStop, I think that in a society that so thoroughly disempowers us, convinces us that we have so little ability to change the machine, the system that our lives take place in, to do something that had a visible impact on Wall Street, it was too much for anyone to compute. Just seeing that kind of impact that people could have on something like the stock market was partially what made this such a big story. Doug, I know that this has been a really big issue for you, and you’ve been leading this charge for many years to kind of highlight the disconnect between what Wall Street says it is, what the stock market says it is, and what it actually is. Could you talk a little bit about how that relates to what unfolded over the past week? Doug Henwood: Yeah. This theory is that the stock market is supposed to be a way of rationally allocating capital on a system-wide basis towards the most profitable pursuit, most worthy pursuits, which are also the most profitable pursuits in standard ideology. That’s just nonsensical. The stock market has almost nothing to do with funding real businesses, really close to nothing to do. Almost all the stock that is traded was issued years ago, companies don’t get any money out of their stock at all. Every now and then, you have a company doing a public offering. They’re relatively small. The trading apparatus that has grown up around it is so much larger than any of that. Venture capital firms actually do fund new businesses. That, too, is relatively small compared to the size of the rest of Wall Street. That story, that is has something to do with a rational allocation of capital is utterly nonsensical. I’m going to say there are two important features of the stock market. One is that it’s just a giant arena of mob psychology. The best thing ever written on speculative markets is Chapter 12 of Keynes’ General Theory. He does a psychoanalysis of the stock market. One of the points he makes is that to be a successful investor, you don’t have to anticipate what the actual future is going to be, just what people think the actual future is going to be. As he said, [inaudible 00:20:48] to ape unreason proleptically. It’s a lovely phrase that most economists today can’t write.  Yeah, it’s just a big mob game. You’re trying to outwit the other guy, you’re trying to be there first and leave somebody else holding the bag when it all goes bad. And somebody’s going to get left holding a lot of bags after this GameStop thing is over, I’m sure. And now, they’re moving in on silver, although it’s debatable exactly who “they” is in this case. The other aspect of it is, I think that most people overlook, is that the market doesn’t provide funding for real businesses, but it’s a way to create a whole class of owners, a way of creating an owning class. In the 19th century, most businesses were owned by either individual capitalists or a small partnership of capitalists. As the 19th turned into the 20th century, you developed these large public corporations that are owned by outside stockholders, and that meant that rich people were able to own, they were not tied to the fate of a single firm anymore. They were able to spread their risk and own or have a claim in the entire apparatus of the economy.  That’s another way of thinking of a stock market, is a way to create an owning class. They extract tons and tons of money through dividends, through stock buy-backs, through capital gains. Trillions and trillions of dollars. The idea that it’s investors providing money to companies through the stock market is exactly backwards. It’s that companies are providing money to their investors through just transferring trillions of dollars through these various mechanisms. Finally, every time that there’s some kind of disruption in the stock market, you hear these people warning, well, people, it’s going to hurt the little guy because of his pension plan. Only about half of American families have any kind of retirement account at all. The average size of that is about $65,000. That’s roughly a year’s income for a typical American household, and that’s only half of households that have these kinds of retirement accounts. For most people, it’s utterly marginal. It’s really a story for the top 10 percent, the top five percent of the society. Somehow, they create these ideas that it’s really everyone’s, when it’s really not. Maximillian Alvarez: I think you mentioned this on The Daily Show, that around 95 percent of stocks are owned by, like, the top five percent. Doug Henwood: Yeah, and that’s people who own stock directly, not through mutual funds or pension funds, but people who own stock directly. If you look at it more broadly, through the indirect ownership, it’s also extraordinarily concentrated. For most people it’s, not just most, almost everyone, it’s utterly meaningless. Maximillian Alvarez: I’m tempted to name this conversation Aping Unreason now. Doug Henwood: (laughs)  Edward Ongweso Jr.: (laughs) Doug Henwood: Proleptically. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah, proleptically. Edward, I know that this is also something that really comes through in the pieces that you’ve been writing. In the arena, that arena that Keynes wrote about of aping unreason proleptically, people who trade on Wall Street, they’re not stupid. They’re trying to kind of minimize and mitigate the risks that they’re going to take, and that’s kind of something that has been born out in the writing that you’ve done, where you’ve shown, look, this isn’t necessarily a David vs. Goliath sort of story where a bunch of rag-tag Redditers made hedge funds lose a lot of money.  That’s part of the story, but also, like you said, firms like BlackRock, who have more holdings than any other firm in the world, they made a killing on this. Could you talk about, in terms of your kind of thesis that as long as the house is still standing, the house is always going to win? Could you talk a bit about how that kind of shadow game that the stock market is, that Doug talked about, how the kind of key players that you’ve been focusing on are trying to kind of control the amount of risk that they take on in that game? Edward Ongweso Jr.: Institutional investors, they are, I think a big general problem in terms of corporate governance, in terms of how public companies, publicly-listed companies are actually run, there is something, I guess referred to generally, is like a problem of 12, where there’s a threat or a risk, that through partly the concentration of ownership and shares that a few large asset managers, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have either top shareholder position or one of the top five shareholder positions in like 90 percent of the S&P, also coupled with the way in which these firms can take advantage of their wide holdings to issue positions, views, memos that benefit from the massive amount of holding they have to push boards to act one way, vote against a resolution, vote for a resolution, vote for a director, not a director, or by accumulating enough of the voting power, that they are the swing and decisor vote.  Institutional investors, the real threat with them is they get obscured in these moments as operators that can influence, block social policy, political policy, veto it, essentially. I think climate is a really great example on this. Kate has reported a lot on how BlackRock itself stands in the way of a lot of potential climate policy simply because it can say, on the one hand, we’ll stop investing in this fossil fuel extraction. They’ll say they’ll stop investing in coal, but they have billions of dollars elsewhere still invested, and by virtue of investing it, they give an industry that should otherwise be dying, is unprofitable, is inflated in value, more political power, more capital to burn, more resilience and viability when it otherwise shouldn’t, and won’t, because of the looming threat of regulations. Similarly, when we are talking about the financial system, the power that these entities have, it’s still not scrutinized as closely as it should be, whether it’s because of their ability to inculcate themselves in the Cabinet, whether it’s because their focus is something that most Americans are not just dealing with in day-to-day life, they are concerns to anyone who’s interested in making sure that public policy and regulations can rein in these firms. As long as they’re still allowed to operate with little to no scrutiny, you cannot bet against them in any way, or you can’t run against them, you can’t field policies that oppose them, you can’t seriously threaten them, unless you are going to undermine their hold on corporations across the economy, across the world. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah. This time last year, give or take a couple of weeks, there was a nationwide strike in France when Emmanuel Macron was proposing to kind of totally revamp the pension system there. I remember interviewing a bunch of French strikers involved then, and there was a reason that, in January I believe, a bunch of the French strikers went to the headquarters of BlackRock and made a bonfire in their foyer. They knew who the shadowy enemy behind Macron’s policy was. I think that you’re right, and as Kate has reported, we need look no further than energy and oil and all that stuff, and how the major players there have been kind of rigging the game. Kate, could you talk a little bit about that, and also, I know that you mentioned in your article this kind of totally ridiculous ideology that firms like BlackRock will say, where there’s an inherent rationality to the market that is going to be the driving force behind solving climate change? Kate Aronoff: Yeah. Yeah. BlackRock is so interesting, and I think it’s helpful to sort of parse out a couple different things that are happening. One is that, as I had mentioned, BlackRock has just at every turn sought to insulate itself from any sort of regulation, most famously making sure that it wasn’t a systemically important financial institution, to lobby it aggressively, to prevent, even though it’s a sort of monopoly provider of the software called Aladdin, the risk management software, to central banks all over the world, and that is just really deeply woven into the global financial system. It is, by all accounts, a systemically important financial institution. That, and it is integrating itself into the Biden administration in order to make sure that it is insulated further from sort of basic democratic accountability. That’s one thing, and then the other thing that’s interesting about BlackRock is that it’s not an investment bank. It is sort of what it says it is, it sells itself as, which is a big asset manager.  What that means, with regard to climate, is that so long as the companies it’s investing in, it’s investing its clients’ money in, are profitable, they’ll keep investing in those. The vast majority of BlackRock’s products are these passive investment funds. That’s where they make most of their money, is through these funds they don’t really control. It will be like the S&P 500 that it’s indexed to, and so what they’ve done in trying to make this kind of climate turn is to create new financial products, new sustainable investment platforms, this sort of niche operating, part of their operations, which are getting bigger. [ESP 00:30:58] is becoming more profitable. It is becoming more and more profitable to invest in green things, but their bread and butter continues to be these passive funds, which are investing in Exxon Mobil and Chevron, in all of the big oil and gas companies and that they’re not really trying to change. They’re not really trying to change what that is. On the one hand, BlackRock needs to be regulated much more heavily than it is right now, but something also has to make those companies unprofitable in order for them to stop investing in them. Otherwise, they’re going to do what they do, which is to make money. That’s the only reason why BlackRock exists. It has no social mission, it has no sort of the higher order thoughts about what the planet should look like. It’s just there to make money.  Until Exxon Mobil or Chevron or BP or whatever is not profitable anymore, they’ll keep funneling money into them. I think that’s what really has to happen, is that you have to cut off and phase down fossil fuel production at its source, and pass commonsense regulations to make those companies, which are massively over-valued, they’re pumped up with subsidies, have gotten bailed out in the last year, are being really propped up by all of the state policy. You have to make that unprofitable in order for BlackRock to stop doing that, in order for BlackRock to stop funneling money into them. I think there’s a couple different things that have to happen, and BlackRock is really at the center of making sure that not many of them do. Maximillian Alvarez: In our remaining few minutes, let’s talk about the what-is-to-be-done question. I think that one thing that is very clear from our conversation is that there are multiple ways that we should be thinking about that question. There is kind of the role that government can play in terms of regulating these things, but there is also the role that people can play in, like you said, Kate, kind of cutting things off at the source or disrupting the system where it’s most vulnerable. I know, Doug, that’s what you kind of said at the beginning when you talked about a general strike would be a much more effective strategy than everyone hopping on Robinhood and trying to lose a bunch of money for hedge fund managers. By way of rounding out, what do you all think about what the big take-aways from this are, in terms of what people who see the destructiveness that is inherent in what we have watched unfold over this past week, and even the past decades, people who want to do something about it, what options do we have, both on the governmental side and on the grassroots side? Doug, what do you think? Doug Henwood: What I’d like to see people take away from this, for one, is that the financial markets are economically somewhere between pointless and destructive. It disappointed me to see some people finding some political meaning in these shenanigans. I enjoyed the schadenfreude as much as anyone, but we have to realize it’s not going to change anything in the long term. A concluding observation, something that could be done, which if we wanted to talk about climate, which is probably the most important long-term issue the world faces, strike the probably, it is the most important long-term issue the world faces. There could be some very interesting things that would come out of the financial regulators. The Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, some years ago made some noise, rather lonely at first, in which he said that financial markets have to recognize that carbon assets are going to be worthless some day. Shell and all the others are trading at high prices now, but they’re really sitting on assets that are going to be worth zero at some point. Regulators need to force companies and the markets to recognize this fact. Janet Yellen has made some noises along those lines. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has. It’s not revolutionary. It’s not a general strike, but it’s something very constructive that regulators could do to really change this. It’s not going to happen because the carbon companies see the light some day. They need to be forced to. That’s the way to do it, expropriate them through rather technocratic means, but it would have a profound effect. Maximillian Alvarez: Edward, what about you? What do you think some of the big take-aways are from this? Edward Ongweso Jr.: I think one of the big take-aways is it feels the capital markets, or at least the rules around capital markets, are just too loose to allow, or to expect, as Doug was talking about, real change to just come from them. I think Larry Fink in Kate’s article said something like he wants capitalism to be self-regulating, as he sits on $8 trillion in assets and $21 trillion, that we know about, on Aladdin, which manages other peoples’ assets. This is small things, or I mean, not small, but reclassifying BlackRock and other asset managers too big to fail, reining them in, putting limits on passively-managed fund, actively-managed funds, but also, I think, stepping back with regards to markets themselves, figuring out how to rein in a stock market that is just decoupled from reality, or figuring out what we want to do with that.  At the end of the day, this bubble with GameStop is also reflected with the fact that you can have companies like Uber, which never make a profit, business models exploitation, up billions of dollars after passing certain laws that let them keep their business model. You can have companies like WeWork that almost hit the market with no discernible business model as well, other than burning investor capital.  These all speak to just the fundamental inefficiency of capital markets, and through the unbelievable amounts of power and autonomy that they seem to have from regulation. States need to come in and intervene. As everybody’s talked about here, all these faces are constructed because of the state, either through laws or also through norms that are enforced, or specific regulations, they can be constrained even further or regulation and oversight can be expanded even further. Until that is looked at vs. what some of the largest capitalists want, which is to just keep self-regulating, then there’s nothing that’s going to happen. All of that also needs to be happening at the same time as developing political power and labor power to push back on the ground as well. Maximillian Alvarez: Kate, what are your take-away thoughts on this? Kate Aronoff: Yeah, I would agree with everything Doug and Ed said, especially the fact that sort of mucking around in financial markets is a really poor substitute for class struggle. In Ed’s piece, he put it, the house always wins. I grew up 45 minutes from LA in [inaudible 00:38:31] City and you’re not going to beat the casino by playing the game and, more often than not, a casino will extract money from the community. It’s the real world, the story. I think if this shed some light on just the nonsense that’s been happening on Wall Street, I think that’s good but, at the end of the day, I think the challenge is basically the same, which is as everyone has said, to have the state really place constraints and more proactively shape the world in which Wall Street operates, if not destroy whole parts of that world which are just inherently sort of destructive and also to build power, which I don’t foresee happening probably on Wall Street. That’s Reddit pages and will probably happen in more places among people coming together online and in real life. Maximillian Alvarez: Yeah. I’m not a betting man, but I would bet building worker power may be a more effective strategy. Unfortunately, that’s all the time that we have for today, but I so thoroughly enjoyed this discussion and I can’t thank our amazing panelists enough for making time to share their insights with us. If you enjoyed this conversation, please let us know about it. Like I said at the top of the conversation, let us know what types of topics you want us to cover moving forward. Thank you all for joining us for The Real News Network. I’m Editor-in-Chief Maximilian Alvarez. Wall Street was in a tizzy last week after a band of Redditors on the forum r/wallstreetbets worked together to drastically inflate the stock price of brick-and-mortar retailers like GameStop. The guerrilla stock-buying surge caused some hedge funds shorting GameStop stock to lose a boatload of money, and a David vs. Goliath narrative emerged—but the story is more complicated than that. On this special panel, hosted by TRNN Editor-in-Chief Maximillian Alvarez, we talk about what actually happened last week on Wall Street, who the winners and losers are, and what this whole saga means for those who want to resist the domination of finance capital. Our brilliant panel includes: Doug Henwood, economic journalist and host of “Behind the News”; Kate Aronoff, staff writer at The New Republic and author of “Overheated: How Capitalism Broke the Planet—And How We Fight Back”; and Edward Ongweso Jr., staff writer at Motherboard (Vice) and co-host of “This Machine Kills” podcast. \n",

      " Content: Eddie Conway: Thank you for joining me for this episode of Rattling the Bars. In past episodes, we have been focusing on the well-being of elderly prisoners in the prison industrial complex. Since then, this pandemic, COVID-19 has hit, we have increased our coverage of the conditions inside in relationship to elderly prisoners. Obviously, they are more susceptible to catching COVID-19 than any other part of the population, they’re in overcrowded conditions, and we think they need to have available if they want the vaccine, but I want to take a minute today just to focus on one elderly prisoner. So joining me today to talk about Sundiata Acoli, is Reverend Lukata Mjumbe. Thanks for joining me, Reverend Lukata. Would you talk a little bit about Sundiata Acoli’s situation? Who is he? Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Thank you, Brother Conway. My name is the Reverend Lukata Mjumbe, and I’m a member of the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign, and it’s my privilege to be here with you today and to be connected with your listeners to talk about Sundiata Acoli. Sundiata Acoli is an 84 year old father and grandfather. He was born in 1937 in Texas, and has been in prison since 1973. He dedicated his life as an activist, as an organizer connected with the civil rights and the Black Liberation Movement in the 1960s and 70s, And he committed himself to the struggle for freedom and justice, and has been locked in a prison cell since 1973. I connected with Sundiata back when I was a college student working for Amnesty International USA, and I was looking at a list of men and women from the 1960s and 70s that had been incarcerated in relationship to their political activities and involvement in various political movements, and I connected with Sundiata back then. I began writing to him as a young man in my early 20s, while he was in prison, and have been working since that time for his freedom. I never imagined that I would be almost 50 years old and still working for his freedom, but on January the 14th, Sundiata turned 84 years old in prison, and there is a growing movement of people across the State of New Jersey, across the country, that are calling for us to bring Sundiata home. When I was in my 20s, I was an activist and an organizer myself. Today, I am a pastor. I’m the pastor of a Presbyterian church in Princeton, New Jersey, and I have joined together with other pastors, and imams, and rabbis, and faith leaders from around the state that have said almost 48 years is too long for Sundiata Acoli to have been in prison. This octogenarian prisoner is in jeopardy right now. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 last year, and we prayed, and we prayed, and we prayed that his life would not be lost, and our prayers were answered. But now we know that he continues to be in jeopardy, not only because the institution where he is incarcerated right now is under a lockdown as a result of COVID-19, but because Sundiata, as an 84 year old man, has a number of other health conditions, which make him especially vulnerable. So we’re calling upon people around the country, around the state, to join with us in saying, “Bring Sundiata home,” and again, I thank you for giving me the opportunity just to talk with you just a little bit about Sundiata, about who he is, about who he’s been, but as importantly, looking forward to whatever future that he has left, which we hope and pray will be outside of a prison cell, rather than to [inaudible 00:04:37]. Eddie Conway: Can you tell me a little bit about his family? Obviously, he’s been locked up for 48 years, that’s a long time. How is this affecting them? Do he have support, and what’s the situation with the family? Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Well, it’s one of those questions that often comes up with any prisoners that you are working for their release. They ask, “Well, do they have family? What’s their family situation? Do they have a family and community that would welcome them when they come home?” Oftentimes, when people have been in prison, even for a short period of time, they may have lost all contact with any other people, and that can be a very real contributing factor to difficulties in integrating back into communities outside of the prison facility. Well, Sundiata has two daughters who love him, who have written letters on his behalf, who have written to the governor, who have made appeals to him. There’s one daughter who lives in Texas, the other who is in New York, and they have said, “Look, we are ready to receive our father. We are ready to allow our father to have the rest of his life, not only with us, but also with his grandchildren, where he will have the opportunity to be loved and to be cared for. We have a place for him, there will be no problem,” and Sundiata has an extended family, even beyond his daughters and his grandchildren. He has a loving community of people that, as I mentioned before, have been working for decades to see his release and are looking forward to receiving him, and welcoming him, and caring for him, as he moves further into the twilight of his life. Eddie Conway: Okay. I can’t verify this, but I believe that somewhere in Texas in his earlier years before he joined the Black Panther Party, he was involved in the NASA program down in Texas. Do you know anything about that? Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Absolutely. Now there are many, many people who were brilliant and had all kinds of different types of work that they did prior to their involvement in the civil rights movement and during their involved in the civil rights movement. But yes, Sundiata was and is a mathematician. He was a computer programmer, he worked for NASA, he worked for a number of computer programming firms when he was in New York, and worked as a member of the Black Panther Party while he was in New York. And so, yes, this is someone who had serious and has serious skills and opportunities, and decided aside and alongside all of that, that he wanted to use the natural gifts that he had, and the skills and the talents that he developed as a part of a freedom movement. So when we talk about Sundiata, we talk about him as a human being, that he is someone who yes, was highly skilled, highly educated. Yes, that worked for NASA, was a computer programmer. Now, my brother, I suspect that computer systems have changed quite a bit in 2021, as opposed to the systems that he was dealing with back in the late 60s and early 70s, but Sundiata is someone who has always been incredibly gifted and talented. I remember when I was a college student, and classmates of mine and student members of the organization that I was a part of in Atlanta, Georgia, we used the write to Sundiata, and call Sundiata and other prisoners who were incarcerated as a result of their political activities, and they would help us with our college papers. They would give us advice and instruction, and do rewrites, and sometimes they were more difficult in their critiques than our professors were. So Sundiata is someone who we have always known, not only as someone who had a deep commitment to the freedom struggle, but someone who was incredibly talented, and skilled, and intellectually developed, he’s also an artist and a poet. And a number of people who wrote to him recently, I mentioned that his birthday was just this month, the day before the birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King on January 14th, and so hundreds of people around the country wrote letters to Sundiata. He’s in the federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, and he’s been in this federal prison, even though he is a New Jersey State prisoner, since the 1970s, he was moved into the federal system as a result of his history of political activity, and when they are getting letters written back from him, they’re just amazed. I have someone who just called me a couple of days ago that said, “I got a letter back from Sundiata Acoli,” and this gentleman is an accomplished poet, and he sent Sundiata a poem, and Sundiata read his poem, and gave him an evaluation and a critique, and he said, “I am just honored and privileged that he took the time to look at my work, to share with me, to help me to become better,” and that’s a testimony that I can give personally about Sundiata, and that so many others can. So yes, brother, that history is something that we find written up in biographies about Sundiata about his history with NASA. I wouldn’t say he was one of those hidden figures that they’ve done movies about, but certainly, his history and his contribution, in many ways, are hidden, when we only think about him as a prisoner. Eddie Conway: Yes, I have a personal story like that to share myself. I was writing the book, The Greatest Threat, a book about the Black Panther Party and COINTELPRO, and I sent it to him and he critiqued it, he offered a suggestion to improve it, additions to the edits, and the book turned out pretty well, so I was thankful to him for that. You say you are working with a group of faith leaders to get some support for Acoli. What does that look like, and how can people help with that? Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Well, it looks like what I would consider to be growth and expansion. Oftentimes, when we talk about those who are connected with our legacy of struggle and the Black Liberation Movement, there’s a certain group of people, a certain reliable constituency of folks that we can expect to call for freedom, and justice, and self-determination, who may mobilize or organize, and we have seen those communities working hard for Sundiata for decades. Now what we’re seeing is a growing group of people who you might not expect. Now, for example, members of my church, where the average member of my church is over 60 years old, we have people who are in their 60s, and 70s, and 80s, and 90s who are saying, “What in the world is going on? Why is this man 84 years old, still in prison? He’s no threat to commit additional crimes. There is no recidivism contradiction that we have to deal with.” When we look at Sundiata, we see that he has had a perfect disciplinary record for 27 years without any infractions whatsoever. And so, now what we’re finding are older people who may not know anything about in great detail, the history of our freedom movement. Now we’re finding people who are coming out of faith communities, whether they be historic black churches, whether they be large churches or small churches, whether they be white churches, or brown churches, or urban churches, or suburban churches, whether they be rabbis, or imams. I was on a call just last night with a group of believers from a temple in Hillsborough, New Jersey, and we were talking about the documentary that was on Netflix by Ava DuVernay, 13, and they were able to make a connection with the contradictions that we see within the system of mass incarceration, with the particular case of Sundiata Acoli, And they themselves have made commitments to write letters, to reach out. So the ways that we can help are manifold. The first thing that I ask people to do, is if you’re on social media, and if you receive and connect with information in that way, go to the hashtag, #BringSundiataHome. if you go to the hashtag #BringSundiataHome, you’re going to find access to the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign website, for example, which is www.sundiata, and I’ll spell it out, Sundiata Acoli, www. S-U-N-D-I-A-T-A A-C-O-L-I .org. And so, when you go to the website, you’ll find information in terms of Sundiata’s case, you’ll find information about how you can write him directly at the federal correctional institution in Cumberland, Maryland, Sundiata’s quote, slave name, the name before he accepted his African name, was Clark Squire. And so, you’ll have to write him with Sundiata Acoli with Squire in parentheses, and his prison number, number 39794-066, and then you’ll send it to P.O. Box 1000, Cumberland, Maryland, to the federal correctional institution at Cumberland, Maryland. You’ll be able to write him, but then we also will be encouraging people to keep following this hashtag and to get more information, because there are some important struggles that are coming up this year, and we’ve committed to bring Sundiata home this year, and that’s going to involve writing letters to Governor Phil Murphy, sending emails, making phone calls. There’s a lot that we can do even while we’re sheltered in place amidst COVID-19, and some of our senior citizens have found that they can be amazingly impactful activists and organizers from their living room or from their dining room table. So we’re going to ask people to write letters, to send emails, to make phone calls. We’re going to ask people to make contributions where they’re able, because we still have some legal expenses that are ahead of us this year, and appeals that we are filing. Sundiata has come before the parole board and has been denied parole six times. And so, we don’t have six more times, we don’t have one more time. Sundiata, at 84 years of age, with serious health contradictions beyond COVID-19, he has issues with his heart, he has intestinal issues. There are other presenting health issues that he has been struggling with, and that anyone would struggle with after they’ve been locked up in prison for almost 48 years in substandard conditions. This is the year that we have to bring Sundiata home. So we ask that you be made aware of what’s going on, that you keep Sundiata’s name on your lips, that you begin to talk with people and connect it, when we have discussions about mass incarceration, when we have discussions about criminal justice. I say to churches, and we’ve been doing this with Sundiata for over a year now, put Sundiata Acoli on your sick and shut-in list. Every week, we have a group of people who are sick, who are shut in, who we pray [inaudible 00:16:55], who we know that we’re not able to connect with directly, who we know are unable to move and to have access the way they would like to or the way that they need to. Certainly, Sundiata Acoli, as well as so many other women and men who are incarcerated within the American prison system, are sick and shut in. And so, add Sundiata to your prayer list, add Sundiata to your advocacy list, and get involved with the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign, which again, you can connect with at www.sundiataacoli.org. Eddie Conway: So all that information you just shared with the public will be found at the end of this video, and they can get in contact with Acoli through the address and so on. Do you have any final thoughts, something you want to share with the public? Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Well, I just want to emphasize the urgency. One, let me first say, well, thank you. I know that you are one who understands this legacy of struggle, that knows the details of the trial and tribulation of people who are incarcerated and held for long periods of time. And so, I honor you and I respect you, Brother Conway, and I appreciate you. In fact, I remember seeing your name on that list back in the early 90s, when I was looking on the list of various women and men who were locked and bound as a result of their political activities on the injustice of this system. But I say to so many of us who are wanting to advocate for Sundiata, if not now, when? If not us, then who? That we have to do something this year, and we have to do something which is going to appeal to the broadest cross section of people who will join with us in a harmony that says, “Bring Sundiata home.” I’m not arguing anymore about the particularities of Sundiata’s case. I am a pastor, and I have prayed for everybody involved in this case. If you go back and you look at what happened in 1973, I hadn’t even turned two years old at the time, I was still one at the time. There were so many people that were impacted. Sundiata was a driver of a car on the New Jersey Turnpike. You may have come to know about Sundiata Acoli as a result of his association with the case of JoAnne Chesimard, now known as Assata Shakur, and there had been so much political angling that has surrounded this case going back all the way to the early 1970s, and Sundiata, in many ways, has been a casualty much of that political angling, but I’m not arguing about that anymore. Sundiata has already served almost 48 years of prison, it will be 48 years in May. He has served what is almost what would be double a life sentence in the State of New Jersey. He has already paid and served every single year, every single month, every single day that he should serve, and the courts have already said that he should be released. We’ve gone before panels of judges that said, “Clean disciplinary record. When we look at the parole situation, there’s no reason why he should not be released,” but the reason has been politics. So moving forward, we’re not dealing with a focus and a fixation on politics, we’re calling for the compassionate release of an 84 year old man who has almost been in prison for 48 years, who was born in 1937, incarcerated in 1973, who is a grandfather, who is a father, who is sick and who needs to come home. And so, if people can find it in their hearts to understand that there is no need, and there is no justice, and there is no rational, logical, principled, moral reason to keep Sundiata Acoli in prison, I just ask that you do something. That to send an email, that you write a letter, that you make a phone call, that you let his name be on your lips, that you speak to a friend or a family member, if you have a grandmother, if you have a great-grandmother, if you have someone who is elderly in your life. In the Book of Colossians, and I’ll end with this, I am a preacher. In the Book of Colossians, the Apostle Paul, in the very last verse of a short letter that the Apostle Paul wrote, he said, “Remember my chains. Remember my chains.” In the Book of Hebrews it says, “Imagine that you are in prison with me.” So imagine if you were in prison with Sundiata for 48 years. Imagine if your grandfather, if your great-grandfather or great-grandmother, or grandmother were in prison, and what would you do? That’s what I wake up with in the morning. I think about this man, grandfather, father, activist, organizer, someone who is beloved and needs to come home, and I just ask that you join with us. Eddie Conway: So, thank you for joining me. Rev. Lukata Mjumbe: Thank you, brother. God bless you.Eddie Conway: And thank you for joining this episode of Rattling the Bars. At 84 years old, Sundiata Acoli has been in prison for 48 years, and has been denied parole six times. Last December, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. In this episode of Rattling the Bars, Rev. Lukata Mjumbe of the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign joins Eddie Conway to discuss Acoli’s life as an organizer, mathematician, artist, and poet; the push by his friends and family, along with faith leaders, to secure his release; and the challenges aging prisoners face to their health and well-being.

In this episode, we review the process by which PAR helped Pettit fight back, and the details of the lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Ohio filed on his behalf, which seeks to hold the officers who assaulted Pettit on his own porch accountable. Tune in every Thursday at 9:00 p.m. EST for new episodes of the Police Accountability Report. Taya Graham: Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. Today, we have a breaking news update about a story we reported on last year. It’s the tale of a militarized unit of Columbus, Ohio, police who, as you can see in this video, stormed the property of a resident recording them, but before I get started, I want you watching to know that we can investigate for you, too. Please send us your tips and evidence of police misconduct to par@therealnews.com or share them with us at The Police Accountability Report on Facebook or Instagram. Of course, you can share with me privately @tayasbaltimore on Twitter and Facebook and message me directly. Please like and share and comment on our videos. We need and appreciate your support.  Now, as you know, this show is focused on a single objective: holding police accountable. And as we’ve noted on previous shows, that entails not just reporting the facts of a case, but following up on the stories we’ve reported on in the past, which is why today we’re going to revisit the story of Columbus, Ohio, resident Nick Pettit and, in the process, hopefully offer an example of how holding police accountable and getting results is, in fact, possible. Pettit is the man who took this video, a harrowing encounter with police that all started with a simple decision by him to record. Let’s listen to him recount what happened as he witnessed a police officer strike a teenager and how they responded to his criticism.  \n",

This week on “The Marc Steiner Show,” we discuss these disparities with a panel of guests who have seen and reported on them firsthand—from Standing Rock, to racial justice protests this summer, to the J20 protests at Donald Trump’s inauguration. After the grim spectacle that took place at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month, we ask: Why do police roll out the red carpet for far-right insurgents and reserve tear gas and rubber bullets for Black, Indigenous, and social justice protesters? Our panel today includes Aaron Cantú, an investigative journalist whose writing has been featured in outlets like The Nation, Rolling Stone, and The Intercept, and who was himself a defendant in the J20 trials; Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC) and vice president of the ACLU of Wisconsin Board of Directors; and Dalton Walker, Red Lake Anishinaabe, who is a national correspondent at Indian Country Today. Tune in for new episodes of The Marc Steiner Show every Friday on TRNN. Marc Steiner: Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show right here on The Real News Network. And I am Marc Steiner. Great to have you all with us once again, and look forward to you being with us and talking about this together. We’ve all seen the scenes from last week’s attempted right-wing fascistic takeover of the US Capitol, of Trump’s complicity in those actions, his words at those rallies. And we’ve seen the troubling reports of how police handled that insurgency. The men who seem totally unprepared to handle this mob. Some police were injured by rioters. One was killed, and others appeared to have taken an incredibly sympathetic approach towards the mostly white demonstrators who stormed the Capitol. Now, let’s think about how Trump called out the federal troops on June the 2nd to respond to the most peaceful racial justice protests in DC. Look at his tweets then, look at his tweets now on January the 6th, when this mob approached DC. Let’s not stop there. Look at the planned violent response from private security firms and police departments to the nonviolent protest at Standing Rock. The way they had to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing their own land, Indigenous lands. And look at how police have routinely responded to BLM protests across the country. Protests that have been predominantly peaceful. Thinking about the J20 events that were four years ago when DC police beat, kettled, and arrested hundreds of protesters, legal observers, journalists at Trump’s swearing in, and then got charged with horrendous crimes. Think about all the planning and overwhelming use of force by police that went into all of that. And a lot of the other social protest movements and protests around the country. Now think back to the footage you saw of the insurgents storming the Capitol and the police response. Now imagine if those people storming the Capitol were Black, or Indigenous, or others protesting from the left or communities of color, what do you think would have happened? Even [inaudible 00:01:57] surrounding the Capitol in protest? What do you think the police would’ve done? In a way we almost want to have to ask the question, and we know what might’ve happened. We can see from our own history, from our own experience, and we frankly know the answer, what that question, what does it ring? So what does this tell us about our nation? Racism and the threat to lifting protest pose around the system? Just as importantly, is there any reason to expect or hope that the future might take a different turn onto Biden-Harris?  Will anything change? Will eyes be opened or responses be different? Will we be heard? Will they pass anti-terrorism laws that could diminish all of our rights? What can we expect? We’re joined today by Aaron Cantú, an investigative journalist who’s based in LA whose work has been featured in the Intercept, the Rolling Stone, the Nation, among others. And Aaron was one of those defendants in the infamous J20 trials when hundreds of protesters and legal observers and journalists were arrested at Donald Trump’s 2016 inauguration, that was swept up by DC police.  I’m glad he can join us and make us that perspective. We’re also joined by Angela Lang. Angela Lang is the executive director of the Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, known as BLOC. And Angela is also the vice president of the ACLU of Wisconsin Board of Directors. And previously was an organizer and a state council director for the Service Employees International Union, and was a guest on the show some months back to talk about Wisconsin. And Dalton Walker. He’s a citizen of the Red Lake Anishinaabe nation, and is a national correspondent for the Indian Country Today. He’s based in Phoenix, Arizona, and his latest article is focused on the police response to Standing Rock and how that compares to what happened on the Capitol and other things that are related. \n",

      " Content: EDITOR’S NOTE: One reason why The Real News Network calls Baltimore home is because we know that the struggles that the people in this majority-minority city face (unequitable access to resources like education, clean air, and transportation, for example) are the struggles people face all over the globe. To this end, The Real News Network is beginning an interview series that examines the elected officials who are leading this apartheid city at this moment in history. This is the first installment. Last week, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott held a press conference outside of City Hall to give citizens an update on distribution of the newly released COVID-19 vaccine. He was reading from a prepared statement about how many doses of the vaccine the city would be giving out and who would be first to receive them, when local activist Duane “Shorty” Davis, a local artist and activist who, when he isn’t feeding the homeless, is publicly confronting politicians, began yelling at Scott from just beyond the camera’s view. Scott paused. “Shorty, pull your mask up,” he said. “Hold on a second. Shorty. Come on, man. People dying, Shorty. People need to hear this information because they are dying. Hold tight for a second.” The exchange quickly went viral in Black Baltimore and beyond and even led to a dance remix incorporating Scott’s line, “Shorty, pull your mask up”—a line Scott’s team began using as part of a COVID-19 awareness campaign. Many people were amused to see a leader speaking so casually to a constituent (many out-of-towners didn’t realize that Scott was addressing Davis by the name he’s known by around town).  \n",
